case al september federal pennsylvania for for lori for julie beth the following discussion in go on the record are in and this is the matter of of course versus school have as with respect to the issue of certain that have been to joseph and heidi in are counsel for both the and the and in addition to that let me ask that you enter your specially presumably as counsel for the we to in our collectively as here on behalf of both of the heidi bernard and joseph with me is an attorney in my office as well right previously on september the an order which went to the motion for reconsideration related specifically to by the went specifically to our august order which in effect said that the would have to testify at certain the were if memory approximately eight days ago to testify by the in the case in chief another motion to quash or for alternative relief was by the through mr office our order of last thursday the date me think it was thursday the relief in that matter the was advised that yesterday on september the the both of them up at the times for their as appropriately by the and advised and correct this if wrong that both the reporter privilege that they consider to exist under the so that they would not answer any at those re brought here today by that as well as the fact that presume you re here because the have been properly to appear in the case in chief have anything from your standpoint no everything that you said is correct the most salient question then is with respect to the appearance today is it your understanding that the are intending to invoke the same privilege by them yesterday if when to testify by the right that the reason why had if we could have this conference the floor is yours not here to discuss law think we have the law ad with respect to briefs argument certainly understand the opinion and that have been by the and appreciate them don want there to be misunderstanding in as to this case being wrongly what mean by that with regard to all of you in this room is that we got approximately people from the media that are observing this trial in the courtroom plus outside of the courtroom speaking for myself it would be my humble opinion that if these were to the stand to testify and refuse to testify as just to you that think the focus of this trial all of the sudden as to intelligent design but rather the media is going to be very much concerned in as to these not full time not at all standing up for what they think is right really truly believe in my heart of hearts the focus really truly do mean that because don think that should be the focus of this case as result of that mr and have spent days in an effort to try to see if there was by which we could somehow ameliorate the problem so that in certain sense everybody what they want clearly will not get what want because at the end of the day if agree that my are going to testify upon something that want to propose here that more than would want because stand by the fact and they stand by the fact that there reporter privilege here refuse to testify at deposition and my suggestion to them was that if we were capable of something as result of this conference that they would then attend deposition because believe the would have right to cross examine them or otherwise examine them prior to them taking the stand based upon that they would then testify in court we have several is that when we our motion to quash last week quite honestly we thought we did it in timely fashion because we it only after we were with the subpoena summarily that motion to quash so in effect if my were to be upon to testify today by the they re undressed got no protective order at all re just regular people the order believe that you had previously related to the deposition and not related to their appearance in court that an issue for us because clearly we would otherwise object to them taking the stand under the order as it currently or the motion that you re your position that the motion to quash could not stand interpret the order and the order to mean that in sense them as fact don think you actually come out and use the word fact but as one the order that the implication you initially had that you did not feel that the reporter privilege stood in this kind of case two respectively go to approximately municipal in of different and school ironically in sense have to commend both mr and bernard because again they re per story get anywhere between and story might make week if they write number of and that it the that they write predominantly are municipal full time breastfeeding seven month old child and so she works at night when her husband is at home schoolteacher mr little in the market in and he home his son his son who learning he been doing that for the last three this is just supplemental income to them because they re not very wealthy people yet without lot of education in of journalism they believe that what they re standing for is the right thing don have control over them as would an employee of the or the because they are and independent said that their fear is that because of all those that they cover and the school that they cover that at least in the should matter come up similar to this case then they are exposed as fact witness related to them quite frankly this is the first case we ever had in federal court in the that been doing newspaper law and most of our are in county and so you know there different issue there said that the concern that have is that there is precedent being set in the that these people otherwise work how do make it better we provided an affidavit and that affidavit that we if upon to testify would validate the authenticity of the that were written did that in effect to offer to both sides so that we otherwise have to testify by the not accepted by the to have the right of cross examination at the time when you wrote the original order and you used the saw and we were concerned as you well know with the word in as to what the thought process there was dialogue on the phone amongst all of us and you made it very clear that you did not want any testimony that would otherwise relate to and in fact when you the of the you had also that your review of heidi and the clearly evidence that there was no bias in the those the concern that we currently have is that the order in effect that they have to testify as fact upon my interpretation as to what is otherwise unpublished material so that for example just this for example not my intention no no but that not my intention to let you go as far as you could and think have to interject and want to interject and want to be clear because think it important that do that me address couple that you made of all understand and deeply respect the position that you re in in this case by saying that the motion was untimely it was not legally untimely it was untimely in my view only in the sense that it came as said on the eve of trial when we knew that there was going to be an issue with respect to their testimony at trial was an attempt to bring this to head was successful in that respect was not successful in the problem but it was successful to it to head to that extent good bad or indifferent respect to the point that you made as it to their testimony at trial that is very valid point will tell you that the sense of my opinion as it related to their deposition testimony and as and as in the reconsideration was that it was meant to apply the general thrust of that the if you will in that opinion were meant to apply in the same sense to their testimony at trial if they chose to testify and they would be in every way by the and they would not be in the sense it would not revert back to an unprotected realm if you will at the time of trial be as clear as can be at issue in this case and can particularly be concerned about precedential value understand your concern in that regard have to try this case the best way that know how the concern in this case and it is vital concern by all is that we have as you well know to restate the obvious we have newspaper within which there are from those go at least in one sense to the purpose behind the policy that was by the school the simple issue here because it is the understanding that these have that they made these is from the standpoint how can they get something that is in my view on the purpose test which clearly goes to the truth of the matter how do they get these newspaper into evidence they can in my view without the the might say that even with the they can get them in think that their argument at the very least in my view and think the might agree with this the would have to testify say this strictly in the opinion perhaps but my opinion was not meant to allow the testimony of the to go in any way in particular outside the four of the by the can say that to the word and that why the were the way that they were the to have some discretion on the was as clear as could possibly be that what is at issue here would be for example the particular that the wrote about and such as simple did they attend the meeting did they hear them say the did they write the story immediately after did they take at the time of the meeting thought my opinion was clear in that regard and as you appropriately characterize no as to bias or motivation or to misrepresent would be in believe we would decidedly fly in the face of established case law did not view and do not view the law as providing that there is some exhaustion requirement although understand some have said that this particular fact situation and do think will say on the issue of precedent you can distinguish of and not so sure would be as fearful as some might be as to precedential value think this case is somewhat distinguishable and don know that judge in another situation would knee jerk allow this type of testimony are in very unique situation here and that what we have the last thing that want to do soliloquy with soliloquy here not sure if this is dialogue am acutely cognizant of the fact that this trial abundant media coverage and it is surely not my intent to force constitutional confrontation with two and to create side show that we don need to why we re meeting in tell you that if it their persistent position that they don want to testify then we go on the record now not going to put them on the witness stand don think it necessary to do that would bring you and the will tell you to the bar will swear them in will have them sworn in will ask you the question whether they re going to testify will allow them to speak for themselves on that point and then we decide what we re going to do at that point don know what else to do but not going to go through the charade of them take the stand and assert you know as articulately as they can the privilege that they believe that they can avail themselves of fine interrupted you but think it was necessary to do that let me share with you why have the issue that have week and half ago had telephone dialogue with eric because had to eric the possibility that in light of your most current order and because you took out the of and of that nature and because we re going to be to trial by eric that maybe he should be speaking to pat to see whether they would be willing to accept the affidavit in lieu of the testimony think we re beyond that and then what was we had conference call eric pat several in pat office and myself and terry that they would not then in the course of that conversation the counsel had stated for example we would like the opportunity to ask if they mr and say something why they write that what concerned about with respect to not going to allow that question you at the deposition meaning you don know that that question be and quite frankly yesterday you were in trial said though very clearly in the last order thought in the september order that would be available thought when that the quite frankly for that when was on break was going to hear an list of that were to and that would have to rule on those don have time to preside over deposition at this late date know that you respect that re experienced counsel and you know that do know from my private practice experience that was extremely to get judge on the telephone in mid deposition could be one of the most unhappy that lawyer would have got it on the time of day and the personality of the judge after your last opinion on my case don want to call you at all as you see far more genial than express in writing by that opinion though was that would be available and believe in an issue that is as important to the and to you as their counsel as this it is appropriate for you to stop deposition on question like that instruct your witness not to answer and allow the to rule on it was inviting you to do that understand what your are for not doing that and think you can do that if you re telling me that you have with certain but not and if you re telling me that the would not exercise the privilege if they were kept roughly within the of their go beyond that willing to have them testify as to what they wrote in the article and basically forget the affidavit fine everything that set forth in that article then think we that point think you should reschedule the and try to do that if can interject mean this is kind of like my last hurrah could only hope not what next week we don have an order with respect to trial testimony and we don except for the fact that again they re naked produce that order if necessary let me share with you where coming from because think what done here and obviously can do your job what here if you could just evaluate it how long this trial goes you might be my guest in of doing my job doing is something to what it is that you basically have already written if could just read this have no idea how long it took us to write this think it does exactly what you just said an affidavit is provided in lieu of testimony to support newspaper article or newspaper the reporter shall be to testify as to the set forth in the what was seen and as related in the newspaper doing so the would be the contents of said affidavit think actually they were your when we had the telephone conference by as to what in the newspaper article or unless such affidavit is otherwise accepted by all as and the contents of the newspaper article or in issue if they accept it it becomes moot no testimony shall relate to unpublished material or information or to the bias mental or other information extrinsic to what the reporter saw and and the reporter shall not be to reveal any confidential tried to do here is to say they testify as to everything that in those how then distinguish this case from maybe my next case is where an affidavit is provided and the or the don accept the affidavit done is it that there no extraneous unpublished material the clarity that need then quite frankly my is if the issue of the is that we were in our because we either somebody or whatever well this jury trial re trying this case re either going to believe the or you re going to believe mr or mr or whomever when they say say that my concern is that have to have some degree of certainty by your order that they can ask any as to unpublished you suggesting that this language should apply to both the and the trial testimony if you could adapt language similar to this for the trial testimony and agree have no problem in them being at deposition prior to trial with the same kind of language relative to that will appear at deposition prior to trial would like to do that because of my own health maybe on friday in as to deposition if that works within anybody schedule and then maybe the latter part of next week what did was put my surgery off until next friday to get this done the problem friday assume you are getting out of here on friday but not sure of that we could do it monday mean whatever works we do have friday morning off you may have something in of not sure you know have plane flight was not going to be here we need the whole team was the one going to take the deposition ed was there yesterday we do what we have to do usually my pay grade but you know you can figure that out ahead judge if may there are some here that we can agree with but there are that we can this is why in our opinion judge know if our are the did talk to them but took misrepresentative so that they left out to put them in false light and in so doing have that if they were admitted for the truth of the matter would be misrepresentative that what not going to get into understand and respect that argument think got to line draw here someplace understood that argument before what don want to do here is turn this into an oral argument on that already decided know you respect that think there is privilege here and think the privilege sometimes drawn in what to be an ad manner my job is to find where to put the line down in this case traipse into the area of why they selectively used quote as opposed to not other that were said think is to get on very slippery slope really almost bias line of and not going to allow it am trying to narrowly draw this understand that that not what the want in this case but don think it for as matter of fact think if did that and ordered that and if assume that the would not testify and would predict if it went to the on that basis would be reversed don think that that fair area of inquiry to get into artificial when you re dealing with fact witness but these are fact who are also and am straining to try to find fair way to do this believe that to the extent and said this now several times that the testimony is necessary in order to invoke the residual hearsay exception under that the have to have an opportunity to examine the on the same and that would allow the to question them on during their case in chief nothing more and nothing less to accept this language you know not word for word only to the extent where it rather generically wherein an affidavit is provided would take that sentence and simply say that have been provided rather than wherein somewhat artificial or little strained as it to this case the rest of it don have any problem because think it does not do violence to my this into semantical exercise to some degree but one that is important understand to the have got to cut the gordian knot here can live with this and they would testify if we had language similar to this my intention would be to enter an order that is wrap around order if you will that is in effect re reconsideration of the order on the but also to the trial testimony in chief it will be because of the time on me but we issue it forthwith and it will indicate that you re going to they re going to sit for under those ask whether that would be what sense you say what do you mean by that meaning in the you say and you re talking about then thinking have enough work in this case no we publish it but there are who can access the system no the reason why whether it would be don know whether your original opinion re worried about the precedential value no it not my intention to publish it have no need good or bad news fast and in the legal realm it will be by somebody someplace have no idea you be just in an effort to avoid needless procedure or inquiry if could just get sense for what you have in mind and intend by the order they show up for deposition and begin to testify about an article about june we be at liberty to say did you hear anything else did you see anything else no because and know this is difficult but it goes like this this is the best can put it other than what tried to do in my opinion have have situation where the the have apparently either guess not sure about this is my understanding either that they said what was in the or said that they were taken out of context they can speak for themselves that one of the that line drawing here can say that and take that under consideration from the perspective were they at the meeting the obvious answer is yes but they haven that under oath they hear the statement that is included in the article where were they standing in the room did they utilize tape recorder for the purpose of taking down the statement or did they use tape recorder and did they take contemporaneously with the statement long after the meeting did they write their article did they use the tape recorder did they use as it related to that statement those are the of that relate specifically to the contents of the article allay mr think it is not fair game to talk about all the other that they and why they wrote the article the way they did and why they sincerely believe that that into journalistic integrity and that problematic and it not my intent to allow that nor would allow any on anything personal to the think that out in detail in the prior are going to simply have them testify for the purpose of the contents of that article nothing more nothing less because really believe that to do more than that is to create think precedent which would have mr think that even this would do that don share that fear to go any further than that would mean that reporter veracity could be each and every time something like this comes up strain mightily not to have to do that what talking about don know if that it does think in large measure would ask this with your leave would it suffice to preserve my objection that object here in on the record fine note that and that why to do this on the record understand that you object to that and understand the have not only this objection but they have also against that to the extent that this really and what have in my prior think you your position as it to that and understand that position you from the have no objection to the modification right with that brief change to what is little bit awkward in the first sentence the wherein and don mean that facetiously but just as it to this case because this almost like it contracted or understand just to make sure the word affidavit was in there will recite that will get order out for the purpose of because this is very public trial your intention what are your regarding how we should address this it known that this is controversy an interesting question mean if we re not today which we re not going to be don know that it really is an issue just had dialogue in the judge is going to be entering an order and after we receive the order we be able to make decision in of where we proceed don know about that think you can assume unless you doubt my word going to issue an order and very serious going to issue an order and that order will be forthwith would prefer that can say that we restricted the order in such fashion that we believe the will testify might be so bold that we are satisfied with the resolution you expect an order that is consistent with our understanding of an agreement that we will let it to you to address that my intention would not be to address this again in open court this afternoon would just move on have other assume to present and we can move through this simply saying don want wiggle room that we re waiting to see because had that experience now before you indicate to me as you have that this is satisfactory to you will indicate that we are satisfied with the prospective order that we understand the is going to enter and that our will be at deposition and at trial adopt this but don want to do this again understand you don want to do it again know recognize just one other clarification question regard to what they saw and with regard to all of the and the would assume that made after the gavel and the meeting was over of those are afterwards can be as far as the context of those the question that you want to ask so and so said this thing you know it was in response to what what question or what else was being about when this statement was made no too amorphous question the issue here restate is the veracity of the themselves did the reporter hear the statement as it was taken out of context we re not going to delve into that in this examination the individual who who was and the statement was taken out of context or flatly that he or she say it and it inaccurate will have the opportunity to say that during the case in chief or at any other time during the trial re not going to side door you know bias argument by going into context is dangerous thing as it to what we re doing here no it we presume that the statement was likely given to the reporter upon question being by the reporter although it could have been of no moment the issue is did the reporter hear the statement was it adequately not was it out of context but did those as come out of that individual mouth can be any clearer than that right one thing might ask since it is perhaps likely that are going to arise during the deposition wondering if we could now attempt to schedule the deposition at time when everybody might be available to intercede what your next day that would be available if not friday monday monday be in in all day cannot do it monday because get here on sunday wife is going out of town and have to watch all the could do it tuesday could do it wednesday tuesday and wednesday is jewish holiday for me can do it about tomorrow leaving tomorrow look if it any weekday other than next friday when will not be available be traveling next friday be available you know we work through that issue if you re otherwise taking the deposition and we re at trial tell you that we construct some mechanism and we kind of about this little bit yesterday where you hold the thought if counsel the not to answer because it problematic question and we can circle back and we deal with that later understand those could come up in the course of the deposition and rule on those as can if not instantly available whether sitting at trial or not and likely it will be day when sitting in trial we deal with it about later today work that out get back on the record here because we got people waiting and want to get going have to work that out will tell you in concluding that if it is at night if you do it at night will give you my home number and you can contact me so we get this finished we have to do that we do it so we get it finished will not attend the deposition though stopped doing that when got this job else no you you the discussion in was return in session and want to apologize to the and of course to the media handled matter in that you become aware of in an effort to resolve problem and think we did arise during from time to time is the first time that we had that type of matter in this trial may have as the trial it was necessary exercise we try to keep them at minimum and we will keep them at minimum during the trial with that we will go back to the may call your next witness the would call julie as witness been duly sworn or as tell us your name julie ann do you live is that within the area covered by the school it is how long have you lived there you have any have two old

you remember learning at that time the school district was very concerned about biology text that did not include creationism do you remember anything else that you learned at that time right off the top of my head there come time when you learned that the school district board of had biology text they did in august what was the basis for you learning that at that time read about it in the paper did there come time when you learned that the school district board of was considering supplemental textbook what was the basis for your knowledge of that learned that from the paper also what did you learn they were going to have and in the classroom as supplemental text to the biology book did you learn about where that book was going to come from was donated did there come time when you learned that the board had made change to the biology curriculum approximately when was that october believe it was in was in the newspaper that they were going to be teaching their intelligent design from and did you attend that board meeting no did you learn anything else from reading the at that time that they were going to read the statement in the classroom yes like to ask you to take look in the notebook at what been marked as you tell us what it is the newsletter that came to the house in the mail that told that had the statement included that they were going to be teaching in the biology class do you know approximately when you received this it it was february so assuming it was february there come time when let me withdraw that you believe that the board in this case the change to the biology curriculum and its other have you harm do can you tell us what harm you believe that it you in my daughter came home from school and was kind of what was going on in the district with her she at me and she said evolution is lie what kind of christian are you anyway which found to be very upsetting you ask her why she said that her why she said that and she said in school what they had been talking about or amongst her and what going on to be under the impression that as christian she could not believe that evolution was science that you know was true how did that harm you it goes against my have no with my faith and evolution re not mutually exclusive no further of this witness right examine mr you mrs my name is richard represent the in this case do you recall in april where your deposition was taken by another member of the thomas patrick you remember being involved in that deposition do you present in court for all the testimony that been given in this trial no did you get to court tuesday morning whose testimony have you so far some of ken bryan the gentleman this morning were to become plaintiff in this case by the were you not no someone from the call you they me was actually by my friend at work who said to me would you be interested in the contact you and said yes so the you and you agreed to become plaintiff in this case will you agree with me that the policy which is the subject matter of this lawsuit the curriculum change in the biology for ninth grade took place on october when the board the resolution that the biology curriculum believe so yes that policy was for the first time in january of that correct correct january where was your son son was in college he had already graduated from school that correct in january where was your daughter was in school grade was in grade ten you will agree with me that this biology curriculum really only affected as far as the statement was read ninth grade biology no that not true the statement was read to other classes no but it would affect all the at the school listen to my question policy provided that the statement was read to ninth grade biology you agree with that agree it was read to ninth grade biology your daughter had already graduated from the ninth grade correct at the time that this policy was both of your were out of the ninth grade correct one of them would be subject to the statement being read to them that correct correct you to your lawyer that you got involved because of newspaper that you read correct is it an accurate statement that in the year prior to you becoming plaintiff in this case you had never single board meeting not correct in that correct please answer my question and then your attorney can ask you to explain if he to in prior to this prior to you becoming plaintiff you never board meeting in that year that year that yes you never board meeting that correct no had board previously ask you that question you in did you attend board meeting going to say don remember which board with the witness and beyond the scope me and beyond the scope of direct wait at time him finish mr the objection with the witness and beyond the scope of direct don find it beyond the scope of direct appropriate cross examination on that basis re getting argumentative only because think the witness and counsel are talking over each other of you let the other finish before you start talking apologize great temptation in cross examination to talk over let get question on the floor don you restate your question mr it true that you did not attend board meeting in the year not going to say that not true don remember which board did attend some before it true that you attend board meeting in told you don remember which year board during the construction project so when that was that when was there that was the year was it not don remember mrs going to hand you may approach the witness may mrs going to hand you what to be your deposition that was taken by patrick would like you to direct your attention to page and would like you to read out loud the question that you are starting with and all the way down through that page and then going on to the next page page and reading from through please read it out loud want me to read out loud starting on that with which the question that was by mr and your answer you please read it out loud me just make sure get you there and go on board me sense of which you were not the board give me your answer that the record will reflect that was the question and now your answer starting with want me to read it were not the board and we were not intelligent design went to some board it was several ago were the building project and it nothing to do with the intelligent design then go on to the next page and the question that mr you starting on is all am trying to get sense for am not familiar with the for the building project that or that or is that right the question correct what was your answer would say more like was that an accurate reflection of your memory at the time that the deposition was taken that seem right that the board that you prior to being plaintiff in lawsuit was in the year that what said that what at the time yes based upon the response that you gave to your attorney is it fair statement that you as plaintiff in this case in december without ever personally the of the school as they and the policy on which this lawsuit is based compound you answer that question wait not going to answer it until rule on the objection on your objection think there are several to that question whether you were present at any of the board while they and then this resolution and not aware of any testimony that they the resolution think it fair characterization that there was discussion about the policy overrule the objection can answer the question you recall the question no have the question read back please question read back correct fact all of the information upon which you strike that fact the information that you were getting about what the school board was doing in came from that correct correct believe in your deposition you that you at the morning almost on daily basis correct when you were looking at the morning that you got very upset about what you read regarding the school and the that they were debating that correct correct were the two what were the that you were looking at during this time read the every morning about the regularly no that it would be fair statement that even though what you were reading in the got you upset that you never personally one of the board in that year correct were personal in my life at that time where was not able to do that it is true that you never spoke to any of the of the school about the that concerned you that correct correct never them that correct correct never mailed them that correct correct you write to the editor about what the school board was doing no that the first time that the school board would know that you were upset with their is when they learned of you being plaintiff in this lawsuit that correct correct did you ever speak to any of the at school before you plaintiff in this case no you ever speak to any of the who had written the about what the school was doing during this time no you ever receive any or about what the school was doing during this time no never sent anyone or any other communication regarding this issue that fair statement fair statement fact one of the in this case is this book and that correct correct never at the book and before you plaintiff in this lawsuit did you feel that could look at it was in guess it was in the library at the school but was not aware if we could go in the school library and take out or not did you make any effort to go and look at it really interested your attorney to newsletter that you received in february you have copy of that newsletter in front of you believe you that you thought the newsletter was sent in february no me me we have that newsletter would like you to read from that newsletter on the top left hand side in that it out loud please newsletter been produced to help explain the in the biology curriculum great deal of misinformation been spread regarding this policy hope this publication will help those interested better understand the substance of the policy while any some may have about the curriculum change sincerely appreciate your understanding on this matter you was through this policy that you first learned about the statement that was going to be read that correct no believe no about it before did you actually see the statement before don think so this was the first time that you saw the statement that was going to be read to the in the ninth grade biology class that correct believe so as far as can tell so this newsletter was actually providing information to the of as to what the actual newsletter was excuse me what the actual statement was going to say that correct you had no problem with the fact that the newsletter was being produced even though you had problem with the policy that correct no there bit of street wisdom and don know whether you agree with this or not and that street wisdom is don believe everything you read in the you ever that that before so if you don believe everything in the don you think before you plaintiff in lawsuit that you should have taken some personal action to verify whether that were produced in newspaper were really accurate did talk to people in the district other people in the district did you talk to that work with other people in the district you never even saw the policy until that newsletter came out that correct got my information from the newspaper yes the newspaper have you ever had involvement with before you been you been by news before no would it be fair statement to say in the normal experience that newspaper might spend five ten or fifteen person and then only put one line of that interview in an article no foundation that she any experience as to in the question you want to respond to that mr think it common experience and it knowledge it common sense think we re going afield sustain the objection re now clearly outside the scope of direct the objection is sustained you said that you were upset by the policy because it with your religion said was upset about it because find problem with it with my religion does not getting confused have problem with it because my daughter came home from school and she to me kind of christian are you anyway that why have problem with it you recall your deposition and certainly will give you an opportunity to look at it if you don recall it the incident that you re to also you received information that your daughter was member of bible club up to that point you were not even aware she was member of bible club that correct correct that it was she had lot of who went to fundamental that correct she does she received that information from her her in school or in the bible club that correct would assume that where she got her information from the bible club at school they about it the fact that someone in intelligent design does not make that inconsistent with the faith does it spoke to my deacon about this situation and all know is what he told me he theologian deacon at you know if he any particular in theology again the scope of direct brought the issue up of religion and exploring that think it is beyond the scope again the colorable scope of direct and sustain the objection is not deposition is testimony in the case in chief and we re afield the book and you don mind that book being in the library do you no don have problem with it being in the library yesterday if you the deposition of excuse me the testimony of mr that the science in move had agreed to put and in the science class you hear that the testimony what sense believe mr that the did not agree to put the in the science class my understanding in wait mr harvey mr speak at time my memory if it me correct mr that they had compromise with some of the board that they were going to allow the book and in the science classroom recollection is that he may not have used the word compromise he may have used the word concession not sure that there distinction as it here overrule the objection you hear mr testimony yesterday then go ahead it concession or compromise did you hear that the had agreed to put and in the science classroom don remember exactly what he said yesterday no further right you mr redirect no ma am you may step down will complete your testimony don think we have any to enter do we correct is already in evidence may call your next witness the call to the stand as witness been duly sworn or as again may make sure that she the binder of certainly may tell us your name you married mrs us the name of your husband bryan clarify for us one important question and that is exactly how old are your have year old daughter alix an eight year old daughter seven year old son ian and month old son where does your family live mean your immediate family you and your husband and your

education of school meaning that they have to provide his education but he actually classes at hearing classroom your daughter that in the ninth grade is that at the school is she taking biology now she is summarize for us your educational background as said graduated from school and received from in english and also have degree in journalism as well later got teaching certification and state where received my master degree you work outside the home do do you do teacher an english teacher do you teach public school system outside of what grade do you teach school level so tenth through twelfth grade generally there come time when you learned that the school of was considering change to was considering approval of biology textbook you remember when that was was sometime in was prior to the june because my husband was teacher at the school so often that he would come home and tell me knew that there was some discussion over the biology book so sometime before that can tell you exactly when you attend meeting of the school of on june the of did why did you attend that meeting because like said my husband had been teacher at the school and he had sort of been directed by the high school principal to attend the meeting in support of the different that were happening were other that were being adopted and over them and you know it was sort of thing suppose went along because live in the district pay in the district my attend school in the district an educator and was curious about what was happening can you recall anything that at that meeting on june the recall lot of that were happening at that meeting tell us what you can remember about that meeting of the lot of so blur together do recall as my husband said yesterday was pregnant at the time so have some reason to remember certain recall speaking about the textbook was the first time that had really ever been around so she me that memory me because my mother had known her previously she was speaking about the textbook just them don remember her exact do know that she was upset with them about this textbook the textbook process the not textbook it was very distressing for her that the in the biology class did not have textbook you remember if any board member spoke back to her in response to her bill said to her and know bill because at the time he lived down the street from my and for many lived there he to her basically saying that there you know problem with the textbook it needs to be balanced about laced with darwinism it to be balanced with creationism of that nature is what he had said to her you remember sorry sorry distinctly recall sort of throwing her up in the air and saying so this is about evolution was very distinct in my mind just her as she said that you recall young man by the name of max speaking at that meeting was in the at the time that max was speaking because my husband told you was eight pregnant was actually nine pregnant and due any day so spent quite deal of time in the had myself to go to the just after did this whole thing fact may have been walking out of the room at the time and in close proximity to her so at the time when max was speaking believe that there were people who spoke in between she and max at the time when he stood to speak was in the and sort of coming back from the so don really recall exactly what his were know him because he was my husband student though you recall any other board saying anything during the course of any discussion about the biology textbook like said was the room from the bathroom so was sort of in the doorway obviously know what max had said to the board but that he had spoken to the board the that were coming back were assume directed at him there were from bill about brainwashing and remember hearing that the whole thing about brainwashing because it dealt with going to college and getting this education and who go to college become was very upset by that because college and don feel as if were also recall alan making comment about you know there are only two there this theory evolution and there this theory creation and if you re teaching only those two then there not problem you recall anything else mr said this time no you remember anything else that was said by any of the public at that meeting that meeting don like you to take look at what been marked as in the notebook in front of you take moment to look at it you have that in front of you you ever seen it before article yes you see it at or around the date that it was did the date on it the date is june is the author the author is joseph can you tell us what publication its from is from the did you just have an opportunity to read it just moment ago now skimmed it yes another moment to look at it if you need to but would like to know whether it your recollection about anything else that at that meeting us what else after looking at that article do you remember anything else that at the meeting do recall bill making about you know the and coming from and also again objection she going to be reading from the article with her testimony sorry little hard to do this but we sustain the objection mr objection is well me explain how we can do this how we must do this your counsel you the question you may review the article take look at it see if it your recollection important that your recollection if it something or re memory that you testify in answer to mr harvey question not look back and read from the article as you re please right do you remember anything else that at that meeting remember about our country being on christianity and not needing to teach the of other people remember talking to my husband about that in the car ride home as well because we re both and was when hear like that immediately think of my and was thinking about the diverse group of that have in my classroom who all have different religious and how difficult that would be to tell one student that you know we can express your belief but we can express that person belief in the classroom just find those to be very upsetting when hear like that being said do you remember if you another meeting of the school of approximately week later on june the did why did you attend that meeting because there really clear resolution to what had the previous meeting addition was very angry when left the june meeting just because of the demeanor of the school board and the that were being said honestly thought that maybe it would set me into labor because of you know being angry and at that point in time was past my due date in addition to about my education and everything said previously tell us what you can recall of the june board meeting there were many many that at that school board meeting and can tell you that was very much interested in what was being said so pretty well made sure at the beginning of that meeting which went on for quite long time that miss anything so took care of my bathroom needs beforehand recall the meeting starting with bill sort of sorry trudy spoke about her actually hold on me one second to think about this trudy spoke was the high school principal at the time know that she spoke because the thing that she said very similar to her graduation speech that she had said just previously sister had graduated that year and the commencement ceremony she had about and like that that she had spoken about in her commencement speech essentially she was speaking up for the and the biology textbook after she had spoken bertha also spoke as well the department and actually had her as science teacher she information to the board that she and believe other of the science department had on guess that had been set down before on creationism in the public school system or something of that nature just to show them that you know if they were still considering this idea that they might don know be met with some litigation or something she spoke bill had made comment to her about her where did she get her law degree from you give me one second wondering if getting my mixed up is running into narrative think it still responsive to the question you want to put question on the floor was just thinking you need to think and change your testimony in any way just to make sure that getting my mixed up can finish your answer you want to finish the answer or is that your answer that my answer sorry recall something else as well recall charlotte who is bill wife speaking at that meeting as well there were lot of people in the community who were standing and speaking at this meeting because they to warn the school board that they were not in favor of any legal action coming against the community against the school board were afraid for their tax charlotte recall really being the only person who got up to stand in defense of the school board and she was mr wife or is mr wife she scripture old actually all old scripture about why the school board is right basically she also about school prayer and the need for school prayer in that speech that she had prepared addition warren stood up and spoke at that meeting as well sort of urging the school board not to proceed with this many other of the community spoke as well your husband speak recall my husband speaking fact he prepared to speak but he was very upset as many people in the audience were and he stood up to speak don remember his exact but again it was warning to the school board and actually not necessarily warning but just sort of what science do in their science classes and how there is really no conflict here with the textbook narrative the question was did your husband speak he spoke next question was going to be simply if you could tell us what but think she already told us what she can recall her husband said that the next question the objection and you can move to the next question you remember bill speaking at this meeting yes were not many where bill did not speak actually at that meeting believe the beginning of the meeting was an apology actually which he had prepared in advance to the of the community if he had said anything that offended them it to me sort of an inappropriate apology because or maybe inappropriate is not the correct word but not sincere apology because almost immediately after he had given his apology he doing the same that he had always done which was to demean the public to say negative you remember specifically anything he said made like ago someone on the can we take stand for made about the in black coming and taking away our in the school made many many at that meeting did you attend any other of the school of that summer no we attend that summer did you attend any that fall you attend the meeting on or about october the of we did can you just tell us briefly what you can recall about that meeting there was at this point in time it was the change in the curriculum that was being and on that evening again this was meeting were many of the community who stood to speak science department spoke although really know who she was at the time recall her speaking on behalf of her biology course recall bertha again speaking husband again spoke at this meeting again other of the community spoke at that meeting you and your husband stay for the whole meeting no we during the time that you were at the meeting did you hear any discussion among the board about the for the change to the biology curriculum the board meeting no you attend meeting the following week on or about november the can you remember anything from that meeting recall noel who had spoken at other as well was upset about the vote that they had taken and was sort of urging them to rethink the vote you remember anyone access to yes tape of the october meeting my husband and had left early we had our infant with us and he to get home we had that there were that were said after we left about should be fired if they don listen to the school board directive we to hear that for ourselves so my husband had previously the and then at that meeting he stood again to request the addition had stood to request the at that meeting as well do you remember if any of the school board spoke in response to either your husband or with respect to the subject of the sorry alan said very clearly that had said something as well about the that it not policy or something like that that this is not past practice this is not policy this is not standard policy to release to the public additionally alan made the comment that they release the because after speaking with their solicitor there would possibly be legal if they the like to just ask you just couple more mrs do you believe that the board with respect to the change to the biology curriculum have any harm to you absolutely can you please tell us how you have been in numerous ways as teacher professionally feel that in general are myself as well because there dichotomy here in what they re saying about this statement that they have on intelligent design as they re not teaching it the other hand they said that it state and critical thinking my mind everything that you do in classroom is teaching don necessarily think that just in my mind believe that true of all the way dress when go to work my something the make or the that do not make in my classroom tell my something think we re with you know an ethical decision to make when we walk into the classroom the that we say and the that we do and so think that very important you can say when you walk into classroom you re not teaching if that what happening in the school system and my are in that school system that they re routinely that is not teaching in the classroom then that shameful addition have child who is in the ninth grade biology class and this over into other classes not just the biology class that been affected by this child from other school board member in her classroom about evolution being against their religion and do you think we came from how can you think we came from used to be weekly occurrence now daily occurrence and my daughter comes home from school upset about these that are being made to her and you know is looking for guidance on how to respond to these intelligent design is not scientific concept religious concept because don subscribe to that particular brand of religion feel that and my daughter my family are being and my daughter the pressure reserve the right to teach my child about religion have faith in myself and in my husband and in my pastor to do that not the school system you no further right we start the cross examination think this will be an appropriate time for our afternoon break take that break for approximately no longer than that and we will return with mr cross examination of the witness be in recess taken mr you may cross examine you afternoon child is old that correct your child name is alix alix is presently in the ninth grade biology class at school she is my understanding from your husband testimony yesterday is that she yet the section in biology that with evolution that correct looking at her syllabus it that evolution comes later in the course say at the end but closer to the end of the course so she this one minute statement be read in the class yet not no you about two or several but two in particular want to ask you some about those are the that on june of and then the meeting on june of believe you these as some between some board and the public that correct it my sense from your testimony that the majority of the that you appear to find objectionable were made by mr no were made by many of the school board that found objectionable just that mr always to say very inappropriate in addition alan said very inappropriate and noel said very inappropriate just that give much credit to noel because he would say like at least what old theory becomes theory if you say it over and over again those are the kind of he would say they were all very outspoken the controversy on the june and june meeting was surrounding the selection of biology textbook june and june the biology textbook that was in question at the time believe it was the version of the biology book that your understanding very well could be not sure what the edition in debate was the that you to and the controversy that you were was surrounding the purchase or selection of that particular biology book for the school district it was definitely the textbook don know what the edition was or the copyright date or any of that information but do know that it was that biology textbook that was being very rigorously in fact the school district the biology book to be used as the primary text for the ninth grade biology class that would be the textbook that your daughter alix will be with the dragonfly on it already the book the book yes you through it through the book have through the book you have any with the book no don given copy of and was she no she was not the only textbook for that class was that biology book that was all the controversy on june and june that correct my knowledge the only book is that book in addition to supplemental that the instructor you made comment in your direct testimony that intelligent design with your brand of religion intelligent design another brand of religion no saying is that believe intelligent design as well as the of creationism in particular the which sorry don agree with don agree with the age of you know the earth and their opinion are that do not believe do not believe the same as the board who adopted that statement so your understanding is intelligent design is the same as creationism to my understanding intelligent design just that everything in life is too complex that it to be designed also know that creationism was used repeatedly with the term or sorry not with the term intelligent design design came up after the fact do know that in its original context it was creationism that was being used when think of again think of and do not subscribe to that way of thinking so again you re creationism with intelligent design is connection in my mind yes you could be shown that intelligent design does not require the action of supernatural creator and in fact is based on observable and empirical would you change your opinion believe that if intelligent design could be proved to be scientific then would believe it would belong in science classroom believe it don know that scientifically qualified to say you know that believe many scientific because not scientist suppose that if intelligent design could follow scientific then and it were proven to be scientific by it was accepted by scientific then would have no reason not to accept that want to explore your understanding of what actually taken place in this ninth grade biology class that your daughter alix is presently taking it your understanding that theory of evolution will be taught in this class pursuant to the pennsylvania academic would hope so as far as know that is the case because that it is based school and so assume that when they say that and they say that have to pass certain material before they can be advanced into new material that they would have to be abiding by the state take it from your answer you have no objection to that following state no have no objection so it your understanding that the pennsylvania state require to learn about theory of evolution and eventually take standardized test of which that theory is part of it the test yes you have no objection to that my taking test well you know being an educator not in love with or standardized if you re me if object to my daughter taking standardized test with that information on it of course not would hope that they would provide lots of academic information on those is it your understanding that because is driven district that they re going to focus their class time on to achieve proficiency on those standard based sorry can you repeat that it your understanding that because is standard based district the class instruction is going to focus on to achieve proficiency on those standard based that we were just only is that my understanding but that is what would expect you have no objection to that no don it your understanding that because is driven district that will not be tested on the intelligent design theory as know it and as it is written there is no test on intelligent design from your previous answer believe you do understand that the school for its ninth grade biology class the edition of the and biology book you have no objection to that book being used in the class no do not it your understanding that this biology book thorough coverage of theory of evolution did you ask me if it my understanding or if it your understanding mean you have to testify about your knowledge ma am seen of actually in the textbook in my opinion is actually quite slim state of course actually to me it more of historical context of than anything as far as what have read did look at that section and basically through the book it to be historical mainly in context of time frame and what he did for science left the courtroom we should ask if you re me if feel it enough or if it not sure what it is you re me about that feel actually that there are that probably could be in more detail but understand that there are within any textbook that you have to hit on core believe that core are covered but think that in my opinion what at it historical context it your understanding that it theory of evolution in manner that is consistent with its standing in the scientific community as much as know about the scientific community and you know you have to remember that not my discipline as much as know about what the high school science say it would be in standing with that as far as the scientific community really can go there because know that there is lot more about than is in that textbook mean can absolutely say that without knowing everything about or knowing everything about science you have any reason to believe that what in the biology book is inconsistent with what the scientific community not no no would have no reason to believe that it your understanding that the book and was in the library for to review your understanding that no student was to read any portion of the book just as no student is to read anything that in the library unless they choose to have no objection to being in the library no absolutely not don object to being in the library just like don object to you know any of the other being in the library as long as as long as it the appropriate level and you know mean there is censorship process that goes into in the library mean as long as it gone through that process and it to be there don have problem with it being there the statement that the school district to be read as part of the biology class is it your understanding that the statement that was in january or for use in january was in june of you aware of that you say that again sorry that precise the original statement that was by the school was in june of you aware of that aware that that statement was several times fact there were different of that statement that had seen the exact modification are you telling me that from the time that they had it in october it was before it was read in january it was again read in believe like may and there was change from that point in time unless incorrect and that is the change that thinking of you aware that there was change made to the statement at one point to indicate that was in the library as well as additional in the library intelligent design am aware that there was change you aware of that change it your understanding that some of these additional that were put in the library are actually critical of intelligent design am because recall them an organization actually sending the library those because there was controversy in those being put in there too there were many of the community who had to see whether those had actually gotten there or not into the library because we certain that those were going to be in the library permitted in the library re in the library parent the that are critical to assuming that they had gotten there never checked were couple where of mine had tried to check on the status of the in the library but were not permitted to go in at that time am only assuming that those are there now because am being told that they are as for myself walking into library and seeing them there did not you have any objection to these additional being in the library no do not no further redirect no ma am you may step down will complete your testimony and you may call your next witness call to the stand beth as witness been duly sworn or as state your name and spell your name for the record name is beth state your name beth where do you live is it or mrs mrs mrs pennsylvania how long have you lived there lived there approximately eight now you married am you have do many do you have how old are they have seven year old daughter and five year old daughter what do they attend attend the school in the school do you have for your to continue to attend public in do what are those continue keeping them you know going through the school do you work outside the home do please tell us what you do am legal assistant did there come time when you learned that the school of was or considering approval of biology textbook when was that was approximately june do you remember how you learned that had read an article in the like you to look at what been marked and is in the notebook before you as right me just want to make sure that this testimony to the extent it to the newspaper article is subject to our standing objection what is june article from the don know what the question is may relate to your standing objection but we note that hold that thought and you can proceed with the question because all we have is the exhibit that is newspaper article let proceed with the question no need to restate your objection unless you want to put finer point on the objection at this point proceed with your question you read this article on or around june the of did following reading this article did you attend any meeting of the school did approximately when was that the end of june through the present like to know is if you meeting after this june excuse me this board meeting that in this article did what was the date of the next board meeting that you believe you would have been approximately june june can you tell us whether when you remember that you this board meeting remember that this board meeting preparation for trial looking back through my deposition testimony and thinking about that had it to me that you know was there at that june meeting what is it about that june board meeting that made you remember that you were there remember casey one of the board at the time during the board meeting with the board that she felt they were treading you know on they were treading closely to the pennsylvania state of on religion in the classroom do you remember anything that was said by any board at that meeting that you in june of do do you remember remember bill making the statement ago somebody on the can someone take stand for what was your reaction to what you saw and at the board meeting on or about think you said june the or think for the record it established that it june the tell us what was your reaction to what you was was just utterly did you do anything in response to that did had wrote letter to the editor was that before or after you that board meeting wrote letter to the editor believe it was actually written before the board meeting but it until after that june board meeting where did you send that letter to the editor which newspaper it to the three local sunday and did you do anything before you sent it to those with the content of the letter did had mailed letter basically the same thing in my letter to the board president at the time alan copy to and mailed copy to mr please turn to what been marked and is in the notebook before you as you have it in front of you do can you tell us what it is to me to be copy of letter to the editor that wrote going to ask you to read this letter into the record letter is hearsay it again sorry hearsay is it hearsay going to be reading in the letter the contents of the statement an out of court statement re obviously offering it for the truth of the matter wrote the letter wrote the letter as parent in the school must convey my shock and utter dismay at william regarding the search for new biology for the high school am especially upset with mr as in wednesday country on or evolution country was on christianity and our should be taught as such statement is in direct contradiction to the mission statement of the partnership with family and community to educate we emphasize sound basic and nurture the diverse needs of our as they strive to become lifelong and of our global society slap in the face to many of the and of the area sad that member of our own school board would be so closed minded and not want to carry on the mission of ignorance will not only hold back area but also reinforce other that is backwards close minded community it was simply matter of text that two scientific equal time that would be an entirely different matter but it not is religion plain and simple mr offend me not because they are religious in nature but because it is my duty to teach my about religion as see fit not the school during biology class that letter was actually in the paper it was did you see it in the paper did did you read any response to your letter in the paper did can you tell us who whose response did you read in the paper was response heather as the author who is heather is member of the school her response letter was in what newspaper believe it was either the or the please turn to what been marked in the notebook before you as that help you remember looking at it what newspaper it was in was in the what is that that marked as is letter from heather to the editor in response to my letter did you see it at the time did read that into the record standing objection as well as she not established foundation that actually heather wrote this article no personal knowledge me first view the exhibit you want to respond to the objection an exhibit list to the other side and we were told there were no authentication with respect to any of this so there no question about the authenticity of this nor do understand and further it not for the truth of the matter so there no hearsay objection on the authentication let take it in two understanding was that there was not an authentication issue does refresh my recollection on that point if there not an authentication issue we move on to the second mr may be at disadvantage here did agree with steve that we he an affidavit from someone who they have collected newspaper with respect to that issue there no objection have agreed that she what she did to produce this article right well there no question then that this letter written by to the that correct from the defense standpoint is correct the representation that been made in an affidavit and accept it counsel for the plaintiff is the letter as being produced on the issue of or to show notice obviously on the effect prong you want speak to that would also note that it an admission of party opponent think it would come in under that basis but that would be the hearsay justification or the justification that would get around hearsay objection the purpose of the letter is under the second prong that correct is for that purpose and it also to show that about the that were made in this letter at this time one of the in the case it could go to truth inasmuch as it an admission that correct right as you know we got the question of whether or not these are admissible for effect position on that we articulated don know if you want us to argue at greater length or brief but it hearsay to the extent it for the truth of the matter as effect think that you reserved that argument had that discussion because it bench trial admit it conditionally consider it in my ultimate determination will be function of the argument that you to reserve and make for the purpose of this witness conditionally and subject to additional argument from counsel we admit the letter and you may proceed you read the letter letter is in regard to the made by beth from in the june sunday assure you that the school is not going against its mission statement fact if you read the statement it to educate our so that they can be of society do not believe in teaching revisionist history country was on christian and are not looking for book that is teaching that this is wrong thing or right thing is just fact we are trying to accomplish with this task is to choose biology book that the most prevalent the definition of theory is merely speculative or an ideal circumstance present only one theory or to give one option would be directly our mission statement can teach creationism without it being christianity can be as higher power is where another part of mission statement comes into play part would be in partnership with family and community as parent can teach your child your family ideology what was your reaction to that letter when you read it in the paper mrs really concerned me made me question first of all was she writing on behalf of just herself or on behalf of the whole school board since it was school and sensed religious intonation like you to tell us did you attend board in after june did which board did you attend of them do you believe that were you at the meeting on october the of was did you hear the board discuss any reason for the curriculum change no you feel that you been by the board do please tell us how you believe that you have been by the board feel it my duty as parent to introduce any kind of faith based concept to my not the school my are small you know this policy is district wide and there nothing to prevent it from being down into the elementary level just something that feel strongly that my husband and that our task to bring faith to our you no further right examine mr afternoon ma am afternoon said your child is seven old she is what grade is she in second grader she seven out from the ninth grade biology class at school correct you have an interest in science that correct yeah believe in your deposition you in your day to day you try to spark your interest in science do you believe it important to make science interesting for your do don have any specific training in evolutionary theory no don want to get sense for what your understanding is of what is going on in the ninth grade biology class that your daughter will be several from now it your understanding that theory of evolution is going to be taught pursuant to the state academic is my understanding yes that will be tested on that are based on those the theory of evolution that is my understanding it your understanding that the will not be tested on the theory of intelligent design is also my understanding yes it also your understanding that it is based district so classroom instruction will focus on those standard based in which they will eventually be tested on intelligent design is not part of those standard based as far as my understanding yes it is currently not these board that you in june the controversy was surrounding the purchase of biology text for the class you know which book it was that the controversy was about believe at the time it was the and biology text it true it was mr to that biology text which precipitated some of these that you were to in your direct testimony correct what action did the board actually take with regard to the biology book with regard to the biology book regard to the biology book for the ninth grade class my understanding that they off on the vote in june because there was new edition that was going to come out they to get the most current book instead of wasting money on an older book so they ended up the version they did they did you seen that book have briefly at it my understanding is you went to these board in june because of the controversy over the biology book part of it said you just skimmed this biology book that was at the center of the controversy was available on the table where the board was sitting and went up front and took look at it for maybe minute or two those two that you spent actually looking at the book that was the center of this controversy was there anything in that two minute review that you saw that you to no just basically through the table of contents quickly it your understanding that that book that was eventually by the school the theory of evolution consistent with its status in the scientific community my understanding yes these that you would you describe them as being fairly contentious contentious yes believe the term you used in your think circus like atmosphere would be quite appropriate is it your recollection that the first time the book was was during the july meeting that you remember it being cannot give you specific date the run together after while about the theory of intelligent design do you recall when you may have that theory first the best of my recollection it was first june july sometime the time it that creationism and intelligent design were kind of used hand in hand interchangeably these public that precipitated some of those that you were to was it your impression that mr and mr noel were taking the as being personally directed toward them only them but the vast majority of board yes they were they saw them as being personal against them the first meeting you in july you spoke with joe believe the first as the first meeting actually had was the second meeting in june guess my question is the first meeting that you in july had spoken to joe who is joe my understanding he is reporter with the during this conversation he you and if you had read or were familiar with some that he had in the paper and those were mr he had he you what your were about those he did he also you if you would ask for mr resignation on the spot correct you told him that you think that was going to happen told him that would just sit back and wait and see what your sense for why he you this was that you thought he was trying to elicit something sensational for his paper is that possibility of trying to elicit something sensational but think he was also trying to prepare for what might happen later on in the meeting since they to denigrate in shouting may approach this witness may ma am you what is your deposition testimony that you gave on march of like you to read if you look on page read from through and then we continue on the next page once you finish that the first board meeting in july he me before the meeting and if had read the if was familiar with the that were in the paper told him just simply what had read me what thought about it and said the don feel that is appropriate me if for mr resignation on the spot told him think that that was going to happen the next line is question which mr you that question do you have sense for why you plead read your answer which is through on what was in the paper yeah think he was trying to elicit some sensational whatever for the paper was my first board meeting just to sit back and see what would happen you truthfully during that deposition was to the best of my knowledge had additional with mr about the with the board you also had with heidi she reporter for which paper reporter for the said mr was for the believe he is actually reporter for the believe you in your deposition that after the complaint was you actually spoke with heidi quite bit at the board don recall whether or not did say after suit was but take your word for it if it in my deposition testimony sorry ma am could you said don recall whether or not did say that had spoken with her after suit was mean if that what it in my deposition testimony that what to at the time go to page of your deposition transcript ma am the question was you recall generally when you spoke with her in reference of the if you look above it to heidi you read what your answer was on through would generally approach me after the after the complaint was spoke with her lot would ask me occasionally my public comment what thought why thought the board was doing what they were doing those such back in july or august you had with the for believe you the you also had discussion with them regarding an interview with the was brief mail exchange but yes you do that interview no did not ma am do you understand that the statement that going to be read to the in the ninth grade biology class was in june of do do you understand that that modification that the book and would be in the library along with other regarding intelligent design is it your understanding that those other included that are actually critical of intelligent design you have any objection to that no don you about the harm that you received based on these and the and the of the board like you to go to your deposition transcript if you could to page you read from which the question until of the next page there anything else that the board done here in connection with the curriculum change that basis for your complaint what can see from the board don know because so much of the curriculum debate place at non public that am not aware of when board are at they really don answer any it this whole illusion of secrecy to the process which you know may be big part of the problem may just be big misunderstanding you truthfully when you that question was no further no right ma am we thank you may step down is probably an appropriate time for us to end today will do so by the that we need to if we need to is the article assume we re going to withhold that pending further that right mr harvey move it in after another witness is the witness letter to the editor you moving for the admission of you stated an objection to that the objection is noted don have to restate it will note the objection you have any additional you want to make to that at this time it right admitted subject to the objection is the letter from school to the editor again think noted that it was admitted the objection already of the we reaffirm that but you can make any other you want to on the record but think that was thoroughly at that time correct right will reconvene little later tomorrow at because of some that must attend to and the session will go longer everybody indulgence would expect to go to approximately clock no later than clock tomorrow to make up for the time that we lose during the morning session we will stand in recess until on thursday thank you all the were at hereby certify that the and evidence are fully and accurately in the taken by me on the within and that this copy is correct transcript of the same in pennsylvania this day of september lori no washington wednesday october the above matter came on for oral argument before the of the at california on behalf of the of washington on behalf of the hear argument now in eric eldred john mr mr may it please the are before you this morning sonny which extended the term of and future by submit such blanket extension of power under the and it the the to argument in way that simple but fundamental confusion the as if had advanced general theory of the or general constraint under which must operate is mistake case is about to an power not about general power of to exercise its copyright authority have advanced particular interpretation of the only express in the designed to give those meaning mr tell you what me about your position and that is that extended the term so often through the and if you are right don we run the risk of upsetting previous of time mean this to be practice that with the very first act we do not believe that the very first act extended at all technically which for lawyer speaking accurately the act did not extend federal term the act term for works that already in precisely the pattern that the english parliament had done in the of anne in and that the english parliament did with general in the statute there have been number of since right if you can get over the first hurdle right the important hurdle and we like to jump that first but the other you re right in and in extended in way that is inconsistent with the form of the test that we have advanced those however were never in any court and certainly not considered by this that itself mean something mr the fact that they were never perhaps most people and perhaps everybody felt there was no basis for them mr it absolutely true that this case is here because of fundamentally important circumstance that the on the much more significant is the first time can remember where this been pointed to as reason to reaffirm the because for most of this period mr the only people who were regulated by copyright law under the would have been commercial primarily and now for the first time the scope of this exclusive right expanded because of the technology of the to reach an extraordinarily broad range of creativity that never would have been before it not the case that the were not on constitutional grounds fact in the consideration of the act they were plainly under talking about court not academic right there is no court challenge mr your theory as understand it regardless of or not your basic theory which on your argument would have been appropriate at any time historically is that there at least got to be the possibility of kind of causal connection between the extension and the promotion or inducement for the creation of some subsequent work but why is that any more plausible reading of the than simply reading that the that there be general scheme in place which overall to promote or induce and part of one aspect of that scheme can be that the that at the discretion of the period of protection is extended from time to time do you require why do you say the clause got to be read by this kind of specific causation theory as opposed to kind of systemic theory of promotion the reason is exactly related to the point with that this is case about and not about discretion it not the case that this no but that mean that the issue in the alternative reading right why is it limit case rather than discretion within general scheme kind right of clause if this does not adopt reading of the form we then there is no limit to the ability of to extend you say the same thing for scope case is about duration but from time to time in fact you the expanded of copyright and itself the scope from time to time you make as far as say translation that exist before the same argument or and if you why not no we would not and the reason is again related to the method we have adopted to interpret limited times have not said that promote the progress of science is general and independent constraint on the authority said it must be to to interpret the scope of limited times and unless retrospective are forbidden it will eviscerate the meaning of limited times does not occur in the context of the scope of exclusive right nor in the context of the power to secure that we then go back to question make that very specific if we agree with you does that mean that we would in principle have to hold the extension unconstitutional mean in extended the term from renewable once to life of the author plus they re extending it life of the author plus the latter is unconstitutional on your theory how could the former not be if the former is the chaos that would ensue would be horrendous under our theory as we advanced it you re right the act would be unconstitutional this would apply such holding in this case to that act is question that would have to be resolved under the retrospective we ought to find another theory then there any the theory which would advance the aim of limiting times in way that is enforceable is only applicable in the case that we brought before you here to the act and would not necessarily be applicable under the act for the the would not advance this argument but the an argument in parallel case that distinction between the act and this case not been here been grounded in their claim that the treaty power some special power advance that claim but the point is there are number of that the act essence you think it at least arguable that the act had various positive to it in of the purpose of the that this act certainly true and we also believe that for the averted to by in this case and the you just the disruption in that context under the retrospectivity and would be sufficient to fit it within the quote severe disruption exception to the retrospectivity suppose implicit in the argument that the act too should have been declared void and that we might leave it alone because of the disruption is that for all these the act progress in science and the useful just don see any empirical evidence for that we are not making an empirical claim at all in our claim upon the empirical assertion about impeding progress only argument is this is structural limit necessary to assure that what would be an effectively perpetual term not be permitted under the copyright perhaps misunderstood thought the whole thrust of your is great force silenced that being the thrust certainly thought that the whole underpinning of your case certainly the case that we are in light of the that the opportunity to build upon works within the public domain is fundamental interest and that the vital speech interest at stake of this case is that the public domain be permitted as source for work about our culture without unnecessary legal restriction but you want more than that want the right to copy verbatim other people don you want the right to copy verbatim works that should be in the public domain and would be in the public domain but for statute that cannot be under ordinary analysis or under proper reading of the built into the mr on your argument don see where the retroactivity comes in because follow your argument under the but if you re saying that the time is too long the public domain should get this stuff sooner rather than later would you explain to me how your retrospective line into your claim we that it would be inappropriate in this case for the to consider the prospective line until they decide whether the case whether the prospective and retrospective is severable and we submit it an easy case to show that it not the argument you re making that as take it an argument independent of it on your argument right right so let just take let say that was your only argument in this case does that tie into retrospective prospective distinction the argument is about the retrospective extension because of fundamental change that when rather than when prospectively prospectively it no way to know who going to benefit from its extension is simply what the term should be prospectively in way that we presume this should presume is legitimate under the it retrospectively it is in effect looking at particular and of who are before for this extension and it choosing between these particular and the public at large it may be that in that choice in this case made an objective valuation of who would be in the best position to advance the of the progress of science or any original you under your intermediate scrutiny test we would not be what might have been in mind test is stringent one have to have an important purpose and the that you use is necessarily tied to that purpose you take that position don see how you make the retroactive prospective line work the line comes from what the interest is and if this heed the interest off of this difference between who the benefit of of extension and just simply in general way prospectively then this could hold with respect to the prospective that it not even necessary to raise the intermediate scrutiny in that context but again for we don think that this should address the prospective aspect of the even under the though pattern been to treat all equally mean the reason that it been prospective and retrospective is that people should be people who hold should be subject to the same regime and not have some people who got their the week before the law differently than people who got it the week after that certainly is the reason the for this pattern of course explain actually what done and even in this case when work into the public domain then there is precisely the same week before week after problem that you advert to that extension does not extend to all works it only to all that line is already drawn in the practice that adopted but our point is the only way to assure or you re not that always made these both retroactive and prospective in it did not it the benefit of its extension to subset of all copyright stick with that was what you said that the pattern under the is identical to the one in the act absolutely right yes they have extended it to both our argument is unless this line about this extension then for the judge below there will be no limit to ability to judge did not deal with the as far as right recall right so you perhaps missing it haven seen where you get the prospective retrospective in connection with your that you re just saying there that is an unreasonable is not necessary it serve an important purpose actually we re not saying anything about the in this case even under the because we believe it unseverable but thought you were saying that if you accept the argument then you have way in effect of the claim of its important interest and important objective when you get to the intermediate scrutiny analysis if you don accept the claim then in order to make the analysis we simply got to say well gee is the promotion of useful art and so on more important than the public domain and can we say that that distinction between and re pretty much at sea so thought your argument was necessary to give us some handle with which to deal with the argument is certainly way of framing why of cannot be seen to promote the interest of speech at all assume we don for the sake of argument here let assume we don accept the argument you have an independent argument in your brief of course we do and it is tell me in sentence or two what it is mean at that point where is the argument we in our brief is with respect to the retrospective extension and the argument is that needs to no but that the argument and it to me you re saying we then apply that in analysis which us to make coherent intermediate scrutiny argument we don accept the retrospectivity argument then what is your argument right sorry saying is not that it the retrospectivity that the argument troubling mean that our argument saying is we have the retrospective portion of and so saying in the retrospective portion of you would apply ordinary intermediate review and you would ask this really not if you say that the is not don think there are where this then to analysis to invalidate the same act mean this would be quite new proposition the is always an independent limitation on what otherwise would be legitimate of congressional authority so this but the seem adopted these two at the same time right in effect right and if think there are not to have that can think of where we have said well we analyze it under the but if that we turn to the that right only we had the copyright before us because of course again remember the exclusive right the spoke of was the right to print and publish include the derivative it include the display and it certainly expanded very much and they also very short term and can find lot of fault with what did here right because it does take lot of out of the public domain that one would think that someone in would want to think hard about right done that it very difficult to find the basis in the for saying it limited term longer than one might think desirable but is it not limited if it is limited then there is no limit to the ability of to extend and that fundamentally the objective that the the rule against might jump in there at some point and we submit the had something very different in mind than the rule against the point is if this is permitted then there is no limit to the ability to extend and that is precisely contrary to what the had in mind when they worried about this problem originally was the problem they were was as this stated in graham could agree with you in of policy that this directly in the face of what the had in mind absolutely does it violate the if it in the face of what the had in mind then the question is is there way of their that effect to what they had in mind and the answer is yes you know certainly what is happening in the country today in the way of congressional under the is totally different than what the had in mind but we never felt that that was the criterion the thought of there there right said there was general grant and that was free to run with it in many many mr but as this also said there are to what can do under the ask you about one of the just on the and the progress of science and useful your view does that is that limited to encouraging creativity by and or does it also include the distribution of that might not otherwise be distributed like old and so forth re happy to adopt interpretation of what promote the progress is about within the general framework that the established in light of the english practice which was quid pro quo the ability to facilitate distribution that if the quid pro quo is that we can facilitate distribution of some old film by an additional monopoly grant you think that permissible long as the grant is conditioned upon the distribution long as the grant other you could have right now if to have law and this law is going to give in the bible ben and the reason they do it is that they think that that would lead to produce those and distribute them and they re right they will your view that perfectly constitutional no that the view of the view is thought that was the question you were getting and thought you were saying must have misunderstood thought you were saying that was constitutional no we were saying is if to permit restoration of for example an issue that been well here can say if you restore the film then the restoration copyright so long as it originality as outlined in and it copyright for period of time this opinion in graham and in made clear that it could not extend to works in the public domain the concede that but we stand on that as way of understanding why this your answer to is no they cannot give copyright purely for of dissemination to is that right no all right cannot give copyright purely for of distribution to would need to satisfy all of the that this expressed in the context of this the most carefully limited clause in section is one of the mr the clause shall and suppose in this expanded world of ours that it going to make certain and other from our treaty it well the led the fight for in the european we go with that but we re going demand fair use why that fit within the promotion of knowledge we have no quarrel with the objective of harmonization fitting within the promote the progress of science understanding subject to constitutional adopted rule that said you grant to hate speech we could not harmonize with that rule consistent with our and similarly as mary beth before ours is the only that an express limitation on got to mean something and if it that we are limited in our ability to agree with the as they continually expand the term in light of their own vision of what copyright is about then that the meaning of constitutional restriction interpretation of limited times could of course eviscerate that term of any meaning but under the principle of enumeration as this articulated it this should interpret that clause in way that its effect in simple way as limited addition print is not limited is not limited if each time customer comes in new print is printed so too limited term is not limited if each time copyright come to they can extend the term right the analogy seem to work right that suggesting is here is plain meaning of the term that effect to the constitutional limit in way that that in fact the limit is contrary to the argument which in effect the power perpetually to extend may reserve the remainder of my time well mr olson we hear from you mr and may it please the the today especially the initial suggest one of the many insurmountable to petition in position in this case is that the first explicitly gave copyright protection to the of any already printed as well as explicitly the of in and and in numerous private copyright and temporary of the copyright law and in repeated patent law extended the of federal copyright and patent protection of works as this and some ago in its giles opinion such are very great weight and as that went on to say when consistent and unchallenged for over century are almost conclusive that consistent construction by of its authority under the and now from the from the first through the been sustained by of this and early of this is consistent with what the law of was from the of anne but take one of the early just extending an already patent to an inventor for an extra can that be squared with the language of the provision did it but maybe it improperly when it did it the that our question really that it to me that there may be this is the clause itself is very very broad grant the you view it as entirely grant or do you think it also think that to the extent that there may be they are require considerable deference by this to the judgment of understand that but do you be interested in knowing do you think it does contain the clause itself limited times exclusive and of that nature don think and the expressly disclaim the assertion that any substantive in the the the were saying is we want to give the authority to promote the progress of useful and and did the example we just about patentee giving an extra on his how does that promote the progress of science it may provide additional for the patentee to exploit and promote and disseminate that particular work respect to creative works like works of art and that sort of thing it patentee that there was bargain in effect between the inventor and the that at certain period of time it would become part of the public domain to me it inconsistent with that just on our and wondering how that into the notion inconsistent submit for the to exercise its its responsibility under this broad grant of power to determine that there could be many ways in which the holder of an right may benefit the public by to have that right for an additional period of time the same reason that same that had when it the right in the first place not just the right no the reason for the right in the first place was to encourage invention but we submit that specifically with respect to the but think it to the patent portion of the clause at all it just the invention it just the writing of the work and this to the that were of my colleague moment ago the dissemination of the work not necessarily alone necessarily the dissemination alone no not don say not necessarily for of my thinking about it like to know imagine we have just dissemination something is already in the correct the only justification for the extension there is no other is dissemination of work that is already in existence would not want to rule that out for the very reason want to say do you think yes or no think that it could very well be yes for the reason that in the statute the specifically was aware of that there were state copyright which last as long as the federal statute of the finished those copyright and couple of them at all in your opinion in my example if you recall it your answer would be if tomorrow to give copyright to publisher solely for the purpose of and ben it can do it may hate to say may because that really that an important question because don think that per don think there is per se rule that should apply here because this is grant of to to exercise its judgment as to what may be beneficial may be other constitutional that come into play or there may be other right let me explain to you why it important to me have list is an economic statute the that seem to be by it the extension listed as approximate made up but magnitude correct the copyright who survive their copyright who have already been on the that were given about billion or more will receive an extra billion take it is harm works have already been number the fact that people for the percent of the that have no commercial value after have to find the copyright holder to put them in the cost of that on my in here made up at least billion or they can find the people at all and get permission an innumerable cost un valuable cost to people who want to use it those are the plus side see uniformity dissemination and now you tell me also see compliance with international competitive and the that are being adopted and the uniformity that not just uniformity providing incentive to people to publish here as opposed to publish in where longer might be available is an incentive to distribute works that may be necessary the consistency that is by saying to as they might have said when they the in the first place we will not only give you but if we change our mind tomorrow and think that better longer period is necessary we re this is consistency but it also matter of fairness and it on the last point it that as zero the reason it as zero is it to me that the added value incentive value to produce between life plus or life plus is zero carried out as the do to three decimal divide by for the probability of your ever such work and you get virtually zero no difference between this and perpetual copyright think that that very good illustration of why the authority is to because if you are an year old writer that may make considerable difference in of what you decide to do could it may because you may if you have no incentive if you know that go into the public domain sooner rather affect your judgment with respect to this is going to than later it may might also publisher what the publisher for your prospective work the incentive not just for not just to the but to the the the the film you think say othello othello old the prospect of an extra way down the pike would have made difference think again that why the authority is in to make these rather than in to make these affect whether the because we re not talking about the effect on an individual author or an individual creator the of the were concerned about is gross judgment with respect to what might generally provide to the population it is hard to understand how if the overall purpose of the is to encourage creative work how some retroactive extension could possibly do that one what was in the principle difficult principle given to and been so repeatedly out there that would ever kick in that that is question to say whether there is any limiting when such broad grant of power authority is that if it limited term as the is there indeed any limit out there submit well first of all even the acknowledge that as far as prospective are concerned that judgment that this is being made to ask and in fact the acknowledge that it judgment that this should make so the only point that the if we re going to grant this copyright indefinitely forever would seem that the limited term does it not acknowledge that anything that victorian you could buy seat for was serene complacency about their culture and god bless them but really think this is an important question and as out if we have to ask what the most plausible explanation for this rule to reward interest or to stimulate former new works it to me that it probably the former mean we know that is well it let me say with respond in response to both of those an unlimited time would violate the that was the functional equivalent of an unlimited time would violate the but the specifically did not put in had the opportunity to do that thomas that number should be put in submit that it would be even since the don suggest that it an appropriate function of this certainly in this case to pick number or something of that nature but it is quite clear that from the of anne we have of history of thinking that it to benefit the process not just of the productivity of the creation of the work itself but the dissemination of it to provide olson you say that the functional equivalent of an unlimited time would be violation but that precisely the argument that being made by here that limited time which is is the functional equivalent of an unlimited time limited time that from now can be extended and then extended again and extended again their argument is precisely that limited time mean anything unless it once you have established the limit for works that have been under that limit that the end the had an opportunity to say immutable unalterable unamendable use that used the phrase limited term which then meant then and now certain assuming number of under the statute the exception of limitation which the distinction between forever on the one hand and definite number on the other is there any limitation in the clause the promotion does the preambular recitation of promotion as such place limit on it submit that there no per se limitation that if there is as for if it is true that or that work very well because of the of other the parade of on in other the that we want to be or distributed it should be more or more later but that argument would apply to new but to extension of already your argument apply does apply because the work already been the work already been but the that are works day in and day out take into consideration the fact that decided there an ease of administration for them they get the benefit of the longer term if you don apply it to an copyright mean if you say you need because of in the economy to encourage works you grant for the future but why does that making that apply to somebody provided him re not just because we re not just talking about the author we we re talking about the to the and the it re certainly the prime in this scene they but all of the history of the development of these that and this in its with respect to copyright that the were concerned and the is legitimately concerned not just in providing the spark of creativity but to make sure that that distributed widely and available and there may be many why we re we that it into the public the expiration of the term was an part of the bargain and what but the definition of the term was responsibility in because it the power the legislative history of the act itself what was going on here and why the gave this authority to were numerous there were testimony by the that represent the same position as here as to why this be done why it should be that this done weighed as this the phrase used think it was in the case the delicate balance that was so difficult for to but you what in that balance because to go back for one second in practical economic gather the difference between copyright that for for forever is probably something less than on penny mean it penny on or probably lot less than that frankly can not only not imagine person whose decision to write would be by such thing cannot imagine european who would come to america to copyright his work for such reason wonder why that european come anyway even if the term were because if he come he not going to get protection the mean who are these people that are going to be by that incentive the as we in our brief in through believe it is in our brief that the about the limitation on exploitation and the limitation of copyright period in is based upon the country of origin of the work and the time available that there may be and we describe that but that the difference between and and with respect to this particular author who this particular age or particular author like whose works or whose works properly or exploitable until many after their death of these are quintessentially legislative would be very difficult for the to have was constitutional limitation and for this to say is and again even the the to make that judgment the are only saying that there shall be per se rule that the word limited times unchangeable times there to be limit as you acknowledge copyright is not permitted is the judge of within that line is the judge of when it becomes unlimited there in other judicial review and if there is what standard would this apply to determine whether something short of perpetual is still unlimited the issue before this hasten to say as said before is only whether once the that judgment it can ever change it retrospectively the issue before this is not whether in the future certain length of time would be appropriate but the answer to that submit is found in the and and this interpretation of the and as to the extent that this would find or not find that the judgment made by with respect to the implementation of this very broad power is convenient or useful in of the achievement of the and is your argument that we find and hold against their retrospective because there is some at least plausible basis should so argument to say that there can be causal connection between the retrospective extension and some benefit that can be to those particular works through the retrospective extension like dissemination that your argument is among our it also your argument that even if you cannot trace that kind or at least plausibly argue that there could be that kind of causal benefit that it would still be constitutional because you should judge the extension simply as to general system one feature of which is that from time to time there may be retrospective and so long as that general system the creation of works or the dissemination of works or the preservation of works so long as the general system works there is no review no limitation on the that can be done even retrospectively that also your argument think that fair statement of an argument that we have made and articulated in the brief that unless there is the is because the change that we are living in an era now where piracy is significant problem there question of administrative ease of system where may be different for one set of or different for another set of there that are taking place internationally so that what we re saying is that not only could this conceive of why thought it was the of this clause but that there are numerous that are entirely legitimate in you also argue that the and alone will justify the retroactive extension simply as matter of equity is that the the extension for works not yet but it would be enormously inequitable to have other who put in the same amount of work get lesser protection so the and now you to do the retrospective and the that are ask you why is it enormously inequitable if they get exactly what they were to at the time they made the work the implicit promise that mean they have some right to expect that they will be you know an additional grant later on think that not an unreasonable expectation at all because that was the premise of the is the way it always been done been any copyright extension that applied to work there was one brought up ben so this case involve works that are already in the public domain is correct is is correct why it not it the equity argument under the and extension of the copyright for those whose copyright will expire tomorrow if it not extended in order to put them on parity with those getting for new works why it apply to the copyright the holder of the copyright that yesterday could you could conceivably make that argument but there is bright line there that already gone into the public domain which other or or may then have acquired an interest in or to or be involved in if you don is rational you don draw the line there then ben certainly the difficulty we re just looking for bright line the line that they suggest between unexpired and and brand new is also just as bright concede that it bright line but it bright line that would have chose this one and choose the other one you re saying the presumption ought to be in the congressional judgment about how to draw the line as well as in how long line to draw agree and this we re not just talking about the judgment of the of the the in is the way the of anne was written is the way the state copyright were written when this country is the way the copyright statute the number of of course the original statute was bunch of state or state partly common law partly statutory that they had kind of mixed up legal situation and there was an interest in one uniform rule for the first time around there was an interest in uniform rule and that precisely why the the in the but there was copyright protection in some there copyright protection in other and what we know from the decision of this in the decision is that there was not common law copyright in existence explicitly that the make this quid pro quo to draw the line as well as in how long line agree and this just talking about the judgment of the the in is the way the argument that somehow implicitly the initial copyright statute was saying to people you get copyright if you exchange whatever you have simply does not make any sense is no language and it relatively late discovered argument because it its full want you to finish that but want you to go back to the have one question on the equity principle you want you to finish finished but happy to come back ahead no no you finish was going to say no language whatsoever of abandonment abrogation or exchange in the copyright but compare compare that to there under the same clause where there is that exchange there the other thing as this said there is no abrogation of common law which would be doctrine which would be inconsistent with what the petitioner is mean think you have point on this equity principle wonder is there any review there is suppose you have statute as this one is where percent many of of are going to the of copyright on grounds of equity and the effect of the statute in new works is zero mean that would seem where this equity idea is the camel and the production idea is the gnat and is there any can we say something like that or does have total leeway in respect to it who they want to give the money to basically it conceivable that the might do that if that situation was present but it not remotely the situation here have the adoption of copyright which are consistent generally speaking with copyright which exist in the european our principal competitor and in connection with international have copyright term that consistent with the concept of the creator plus the creator first generation have copyright term remember which the copyright that were added to the period between creation and publication so that the limited number of in the first the and the statute were the number of plus the relatively unlimited period of time between creation and publication so we don have anything remotely like that in this situation have process which as you or one of the is may not have been the policy that you as of would have might have made the balance that delicate balance that this to in another way but that is something that through its ability to gather and make is quintessentially capable of doing and that is where the the responsibility and what this statute does is to favor if at all the creator with respect to the utilization of these as opposed to the person who to copy the creator an entirely rational distinction for to make you you olson mr you have olson been perfectly clear in setting out the structure of the argument is that there is no effective limit on power under the were this the first time this had considered copyright authority that might be plausible argument but the very first time this ever struck down law of as exceeding section power was in the context of the have of history of this making sure that the both express and in the have some meaning the opinion very clearly out the per se limit for originality for the was trying to get me to say the as well as graham set out very clear on the context of the ability to extend works in the public domain those make no sense under the reasoning the the reasoning would make all of those irrelevant and wrong we offer simple way to make this clear express limit make sense and that is precisely the understanding we suggest that in the only that in were of setting term and then when parliament was in and to extend it they it and as said they it because as pamphleteer it that would be effectively perpetual term this delicate balance that the let me give you the the delicate balance is that under the most reasonable of copyright royalty income and under our interest rate of percent as the note at page note of their brief the current term percent of the value of perpetual term that might be delicate balance that they give the author percent and the public percent but in my mind that delicate in very different sense of that term you very much you mr the case is at the case in the above matter was october the welcome the and vice evening from at at winston carolina jim of the on to this second election debate between the candidate for president george of texas and the candidate vice al are by the on the format and the are those by of the two the tonight and the are mine the format tonight is that of conversation the only rule is that no single response can ever ever exceed two the rule for the audience here in the hall is as always absolute quiet please evening vice the end of our last week in boston the total time each of you took was virtually the same see if we can do the same tonight or come close the first question goes to you of you is about to be the leader of the single most powerful nation in the world economically financially militarily diplomatically you name it you formed any for this enormous power have have question is what in the best of the in the best of our people it comes to foreign policy that will be my question it in our nation in the is in our nation hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation in is in our nation interest thought lot about what it to be the president also understand that an administration is not one person but an administration is who are by the president to serve the country to serve cause greater than self and so thought about an administration of people who represent all america but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy haven naming except for one person and that mr richard cheney who thought did great job the other night vice presidential nominee who think people got to see why picked him man of solid judgment and he going to be person to stand by my side of the done in texas is been able to put together good team of people been able to set clear the ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind for our system that safe and secure foreign policy that in our nation interest and strong military and then bring people together to achieve those what does thought long and hard about the honor of being the of the vice jim thought lot about that particular question and see our national strength coming from what we stand for in the world see it as question of is great tribute to our that later this nation is now to by the on every other continent and the from every part of this earth as kind of model for what their future could be don think that just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as really true even the that sometimes shake their at us as soon as they have change that the people to speak freely they re wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more freedom free political freedom think first and foremost our power ought to be to in ways that form more perfect union the power of example is america power in the world that for example standing up for human the of injustice and inequity along the of race and here at home because in all these other around the world where they re these terrible when they feel hope it is often because they see in us reflection of their potential we got to enforce our civil got to deal with like racial we have to keep our military strong have the military and do whatever is necessary if president to make sure that it stays that way our real power comes think from our the people of the world look at the and say should they fear us should they welcome our involvement should they see us as friend everybody in the world would you project us around the world as president think they ought to look at us as country that freedom where it matter who you are or how you re raised or where you re from that you can succeed don think they look at us with envy really upon how our nation itself in foreign policy we re an arrogant nation they resent us we re humble nation but strong they welcome us it our nation alone right now in the world in of power and that why we have to be humble yet project strength in way that freedom don think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are re freedom loving nation and if we re an arrogant nation they view us that way but if we re humble nation they respect us humble nation agree with that agree with that think that one of the that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history that know about anyway there is some resentment of power think that the idea of humility is an important one think that we also have to have sense of mission in the world have to protect our capacity to push forward what america all about not only military strength and our it also keeping our economy strong know in the last or two ago it was routine for of foreign to come over here and say you have got to do something about these horrendous because it causing tremendous for the rest of the world and we were to all the time the fact that we have the economy in history today is not good enough need to do more the fact that it is so strong us to project the power for good that america can represent that give us does our wealth our good economy our power bring with it special to the rest of the world it does for example debt think we ought to be forgiving debt under certain think for example if we re convinced that country that got lot of debt would reform itself that the money go into the of few but would go to help people think it sense for us to use our wealth in that way or to trade debt for valuable rain forest that much sense yes do have an obligation but we can be all to all people can help build but we can put our all around the world can lend money but we have to do it wisely be money to corrupt we have to be guarded in our generosity go through some of the now question vice the governor the we re talking at this stage in the game about diplomatic power that we have do you think the should do right now to resolve that conflict over there the first priority to be on ending the violence down the that have arisen there need to call upon to release the three israeli who have been need to insist that send out to halt some of the provocative of violence that have been going on think that we also have to keep weather eye toward because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make and he needs to understand that he not only dealing with israel he is dealing he dealing with us if he is making the kind of that he talking about there the use of diplomacy in this situation already well it goes hour by hour and day by day now very tense situation there in the last there been some subsiding of the violence there too much to hope that this is going to continue but do hope that it will continue country been very active with regular with the there we just have to take it day to day right now one thing would say where diplomacy is concerned israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing with israel are than or on some of diplomatic are historic they are strong and they are enduring our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd think during the campaign particularly now during this difficult period we ought to be speaking with one voice and appreciate the way the administration worked hard to calm the the vice president call on to have his people pull back to make the peace think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the want everybody to know should be the president israel going to be our friend going to stand by israel that think it important to reach out to moderate arab like jordan and egypt and important to be with people when you don need each other so that when you do there strong bond of friendship that going to be particularly important in dealing not only with such as now in israel but with the coalition against fallen apart or it unraveling let put it that way the are being don know whether he of mass destruction better not be or there going to be consequence should be the president it important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your and your determination of the why think it important for this nation to develop an anti ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the if need be to keep the peace is to be able to say to the of the world or the don dare threaten our also important to keep strong in the credible because of the energy crisis we re now in all lot of the energy is produced from the and so appreciate what the administration is doing hope to get sense of should be fortunate to be the president how my administration will react to the you don believe vice that we should take sides and resolve this right now lot of people pushing hey the should declare itself and not be so neutral in this particular situation we stand with israel but we have the ability to serve as an honest broker one of the that important is that israel cannot have direct dialogue with some of the people on the other side of especially during times of tension unless that dialogue comes through us if we throw away that ability to serve as an honest broker then we have thrown we will have thrown away strategic asset that important not only to us but also to israel agree with that do do think this though it comes to it can be the timetable as to how take place got to be timetable that all can agree to like the and any lasting peace is going to have to be peace that good for both sides therefore the term honest broker sense current administration worked hard to keep the at the table will try to do the same thing it won be on my timetable it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the watching here tonight are very interested in policy and they are so interested they want to base their vote on between the two of you as president how you would handle policy there any difference haven big difference in the last few hard to tell think that you know would hope to be able to convince people could handle the iraqi situation better you mean get him out of there would like to of course and presume this administration would as well don know there are no now in iraq the coalition that was in place as strong as it used to be is danger don want him fishing in in the it going to be hard it going to be important to rebuild that coalition to keep the pressure on him feel that is failure of the clinton administration do when got to be part of the current administration it was right after was one of the few of my political party to support former in the persian gulf resolution and at the end of that war for whatever reason it was not finished in way that removed from power know there are all of and the fact is that that the situation that was left when got there we have the want to go further want to give robust support to the that are trying to overthrow and know there are that they re too weak to do it but that what they said about the that were opposing in and you know the policy of against just in spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week and it to me that taken so long to see the work there building upon the policy of containment that was successful over much longer period of time against the former in the communist block little early to declare that we should give up on the know the governor not necessarily saying that but you know all of these that have come in all of them have been in accordance with the regime told except for three where they notified and they re trying to break out of the there no question about it don think they should be to he state your position correctly you re not calling for the are you no of course not absolutely not want them to be go on to and and it under the area of our military power new question the fall of be seen as triumph for military intervention think it triumph thought the president made the right decision in joining and them when they did so upon the not to hamstring the administration and in of forcing troop on timetable that necessarily in our best interest or fit our nation strategy and so think it good public policy think it worked and took made the decision made the president made the decision he made freedom to go in that part of the world and where there lot of work left to be done however you think it would not have do you think that would not have fallen if the and had not militarily this legitimate use of our military power think it is don think he would have fallen had we not used the force know there are some in our party that disagree with that sentiment the president thought he made the right decision to do so think he necessarily made the right decision to take land off the table right before we ourselves offensively but nevertheless it worked the administration credit for made it work is important for to have it work important for to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in one of the felt so strongly that the to participate was because of our with and is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future there more work to do to be seen however whether or not there going to be political settlement in and certainly hope there is one on record as saying at some point in time hope our european become the in and in the hope that they put the on the ground so that we can withdraw our and focus our military on fighting and winning war been kind of hard liner on this issue for more than eight was in the senate before vice president was pushing for action against the death of so many people was the last communist party boss there and then he dictator that by some other label he was still essentially communist dictator unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in serbian politics just today the of his political party said that they were going to ignore the of the new president of and that they question his legitimacy and he still going to try to be actively involved is an war criminal should be accountable did want to pick up on one of the and maybe have maybe have the previous wrong some of the we had about when it appropriate for the to use force around the world at times the that you laid down have given me the impression that if it something like genocide taking place or what they ethnic cleansing in that that alone would not be that that be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the ought to get involved with have to be other involved for me to want to be involved by itself that to me can bring into play fundamental american strategic interest because think it based on our have got that wrong trying to figure out who the questioner was think it in our nation strategic interest commit thought it was in our strategic to keep in check because of our in and that why took the position took think it important for to be strong and confident felt like unchecked would harm and so it on the situation mr vice let stay on the subject for moment question related to this figured this out in the last there have been eight major that involved the introduction of ground air or naval me name them the persian gulf you had been president for any of those would any of those not have you run through the list again thought that was mistake that that persian gulf for it it course and that again no think that that was ill considered did support it at the time was in the previous administration in the administration and think in retrospect the there are that we should take very very seriously yes then about that me to do it with you couple absolutely sure off as humanitarian mission and it into nation building mission and that where the mission went wrong the mission was as result our nation price so don think our ought to be used for what nation building think our ought to be used to fight and win war think our ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when it in our best in this case it was nation building exercise and same with have either about of them got conflict of interest on if you know what mean do do the persian gulf obviously you have already about the reverse side of the question that vice people in in was no intervention no intervention from the outside world that mistake not to intervene think the administration did the right thing in that case do was horrible situation no one to see it on our but it case where we need to make sure we have an early warning system in place in where there could be ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw it there in that case where we need to use our influence to have in come together and help deal with the situation the administration seem like we re great love for us tonight but the administration made the right decision on training nigerian for just such as this in and so thought they made the right decision not to send into you have any second on that based on what you said moment ago about genocide like to come back to the question of nation building but let me address the question directly first did actually send into to help with the humanitarian relief wife who is here actually went on military plane with on one of those think in retrospect we were too late getting in there could have saved more if we had do not think that it was an example of conflict where we should have put our in to try to separate the for this reason jim of the criteria that think is important in when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved if we can really make the difference with military tried everything else we have allies in the we have allies ready willing and able to go and carry big part of the burden we did not we have tried our tried to create an crisis response team there and we met some resistance have had some luck with but in sierra leon and now that become democracy and we hope it stays that way then maybe we can build on that because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about military there think it was the right thing not to jump in as heartbreaking as it was but think we should have come in much with the humanitarian mission what would you say that somebody would say hey wait minute why not mean why the why the but not when people are at risk understand and is important we got to do lot of work in to promote democracy and trade and there are some vice is fledgling democracy have to work with an important continent there got to be and is priority for lot of as is and the our own hemisphere those are my four top should be the president not to say we won be engaged nor work hard to get other to come together to prevent atrocity thought the best example of way to handle the situation was when we provided logistical support to the support that only we can provide thought that was good model we can be all to all people in the world jim think that where maybe the vice president and begin to have some worried about our military around the world want to be judicious in its use have sent to think it was mission was nation building mission and it was not very successful cost us couple of and not so sure democracy is any better off in than it was before vice do you agree with the governor on nation building the use of military our military for nation building as he and defined it don think we agree on that would certainly also be judicious in any potential use of american overseas think we have to be very reticent about that look jim the world is so rapidly the way see it the world is getting much closer together it or not we are now the is now the natural leader of the world these other are looking to us just because we cannot be involved everywhere and be mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere both of us are kind of guess the other position in extreme way but think there is difference here idea of nation building is kind of pejorative phrase but think about the great conflict of the past century the between and great lesson was learned by our military and the people of the the lesson was that in the aftermath of we kind of turned our and left them to their own and they up lot of trouble that quickly acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in we laid down the marshall did got intimately involved in building and other there still have lots of in what did we do in the late and and were nation building it was economic it was also military the confidence that those from the wounds of war had by there had civil come in to set up their ways of building their back said in the boston debate on this issue of nation building that the military is now is it are there military that you would bring home if you become president let me just say one comment about what the vice president said think one of the in between and is we let our military atrophy we can do that got to rebuild our military one of the we have in the military is we re in lot of around the world one and that the would very much like to get our out of there recognize we can do it now nor do advocate an immediate withdrawal would be an abrogation of our agreement with no one is suggesting that think it ought to be one of our to work with our european to convince them to put on the ground there is an example is another example there are some where think you know the administration in columbia think it important for us to be training in that part of the world the hemisphere is in our interest to have peaceful columbia the use of the military there some people are now suggesting that if you don want to use the military to maintain the peace to do the civil thing is it time to consider civil force of some kind that comes in after the military that or all of that that on your radar screen don think so think what we need to do is convince people who live in the they live in to build the missing something here mean we re going to have kind of nation building core from america not military is meant to fight and win war what it meant to do when it morale strongly believe we need to have military presence in the peninsula not only to keep the peace in the peninsula but to keep regional stability strongly believe we need to keep presence in but going to be judicious as to how to use the military needs to be in our vital interest the mission needs to be clear and the extra strategy obvious don disagree with that certainly don disagree that we ought to get our home from like the as soon as we can as soon as the mission is complete what we did in are no more than handful of american military personnel in now have their but we gave them chance to restore democracy really about all we can do if you have situation like that right in our with chaos about to break out and forming to come across the water and all of violence there right in one of our neighboring there then think that we did the right thing there as for this idea of nation building the phrase grandiose you know we can be we can allow ourselves to get certainly agree with that that why building up our capacity devoted in the budget as said last week more than twice as much as the governor think that it in better shape now than he generally does had some about that said that two would have to report not ready for duty and that not what the joint say there no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military the non military area of around the world the financial and economic are the said recently that to overseas development assistance is lower now almost than it ever been that problem for you you think what is your what is your idea about what the are talking about financial assistance and that sort of thing to other the poor debt place where we can use our generosity to influence in positive way influence believe we ought to have foreign aid but don think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage and reform think lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it up being spent the wrong way and there some pretty egregious recently being russia where we had that ended up in the of lot of powerful people and help the nation think the got role in the world but don want to see the out there as way to say to world if you make bad loan we bail you out needs to be available for emergency thought the did the right thing with and was very strongly supportive of the administration in don think the ought to be stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate themselves look at every place where we re money just want to make sure the return is good you think we re meeting our properly no would make some think there need to be in the generally it but seen them make some that thought were highly questionable think that there general agreement in many of the world now that there ought to be in the the think is generally doing better job but think one of the big here that get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption the governor it worked on this issue an enormous problem and corruption in official like and police around the world customs that one of the worst of it we have got to again lead by example and help these other that are trying to straighten out their find the in order to do it just think jim that this is an absolutely unique period in world history the world come together as said they re looking to us we have fundamental choice to make we going to step up to the plate as nation the way we did after the way that generation of said the is going to be the leader the world tremendously from the courage that they in those post war think that in the aftermath of the it time for us to do something very similar to step up to the plate to provide the leadership on the environment leadership to make sure the world economy moving in the right direction that not running big here and not our surplus intelligent that keep our prosperity going and that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role me comment on that not so sure the role of the is to go around the world and say this is the way it got to be can help maybe it just our difference in government the way we view government want to empower the people want to help people help themselves not have government tell people what to do just don think it the role of the to walk into country and say we do it this way so should you think we can help know we got to encourage democracy in the take russia for example went into russia we said here is some money and it ended up in pocket and and yet we like there was reform the only people that are going to reform russia are russia re going to have to make the decision themselves mr is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting so that if and or invest capital there reasonable rate of return way to get the money out of the economy russia to make the decision can work with them on security for example but it their call to make not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from but think one way for us to end up being as the ugly american is for us to go around the world saying we do it this way so should you we trust freedom know freedom is powerful powerful powerful force much bigger than the of america as we saw recently in the maybe misunderstand where you re coming from mr vice but think the must be humble and must be and confident of our but humble in how we treat that are out how to chart their own course move on no let move on be it from me to suggest otherwise couple of follow from the vice presidential debate last week vice would you support or sign as president federal law banning racial by police and other at all of government would the only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement but would also support law in the that would have the effect of doing the same thing just think that racial is serious problem remember when the first came out about the in jersey by the highway patrol there know it been going on long time some ways this is just new label for something that been going on for have to confess that it was the first time that really on it in new way was at the extent of it think we now got so many around the country that we really have to find ways to end this what it what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly unjustly and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or that counter to what the of america is all about at our core it not an easy problem to solve if am with the presidency it will be the first of the century can imagine what it would be like to be singled out because of race and stopped and just flat wrong and that not what america is all about so we ought to do everything we can to end racial of my though is don want to federalize the local police want to obviously in the egregious we need to enforce civil law but we need to make sure that internal at the local level do their job and be given chance to do their job believe in local control of and obviously if they don there needs to be consequence at the federal level it very important that we not overstep our and think most people most police are good honorable who are doing their job their at risk who bigoted or prejudiced don think they ought to be guilty do think we need to find out where racial and do something about it and say to the local get it done if you can there will be federal consequence that could be federal law you would agree would agree also agree that most police of course are doing good job and hate this practice also to an african american police officer in not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest is in the training not only the training in police but human think that racial is part of issue of how we deal with race in america as for people out because of race you know james was singled out because of his race in texas other have been singled out because of their race or that why think we can embody our by passing hate law think these are different think they re different because they re based on prejudice and hatred which rise to that have not just single victim but they re intended to stigmatize and dehumanize whole group of people have different view of that no don really hate no got one in texas guess what the three men who james guess what going to happen to them re going to be put to death jury found them guilty going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death it the right cause the right decision there is other of racial that goes on in america arab are racially in what is secret evidence are stopped and we have to do something about that friend spencer abraham of michigan is pushing law to make sure that arab are with respect racial just an issue at local police an issue throughout our society as we become diverse society we re going to have to deal with it more and more believe though believe as sure as sitting here that most really care re tolerant people re good tolerant people the very few that create most of the crises and we just have to find them and deal with them if you become president are there other racial problem that you would deal with as president discrimination you said arab but also as well as in this country me tell you where the biggest discrimination comes public education when we just move through the friend phyllis hunter is here had one of the of all said reading is the new civil right right to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be every single child in america must be educated mean every child with making sure every child to read diagnostic testing so we know whether or not there deficiency that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum reading teacher mean there needs to be wholesale effort against racial which is illiterate can do better in our public can close an achievement gap and it with making sure we have strong accountability jim of the of reform and good reform is to measure when you measure you can ask the question do they know anybody being anybody being against becomes tool corrective tool believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money any money from the federal government for for example you must show us whether or not the are learning if they are fine if they re not there to be consequence so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education is nothing more prejudiced than not child vice what would be on your racial discrimination elimination list as president think we need tough enforcement of the civil think we still need affirmative action would pass hate law as said and guess had misunderstood the governor previous position the family may have misunderstanding of it in texas also would like to shift if could to the big issue of education on one second is the misunderstanding clear this up had thought that there was controversy at the end of the legislative session where the hate law in texas was and that the family among you to support it and it in committee for lack of support wrong about that you don realize we have hate statute do talking about the one that was to deal no well what the vice must not understand is we got hate bill in texas secondly the people that mr got the ultimate punishment the death penalty were under the murder were they not in texas this case when you murder somebody it hate jim the crime is hate they got the ultimate punishment not exactly sure how you enhance the penalty any more than the death penalty happen to have statute on the that hate statute in texas may respond don want to jump in may have been misled by all the news about this matter because the law that was in texas that had the support of the family and whole lot of people in texas did in fact die in committee may be some other statute that was already on the but certainly the of the hate law felt that tough new law was it important jim not only not just because of texas but because this the national controversy is pending now in the national hate law because of james because of matthew who was crucified on split rail fence by and because of that law in committee also because of the same kind of opposition you would support that bill you support national hate law would support the version of it not the version let me say to you mr vice we re happy with our on our bill did there was another bill that did die in committee want to repeat if you have state that fully the law like we do in texas we re going to go after all crime we re going to make sure people get for the crime in this case we can enhance the penalty any more than those three to that what happen in the state of texas subject new question vice presidential debate follow up both and cheney said they were sympathetically their on same sex your position on that not for gay marriage think marriage is sacred institution between man and woman the way the administration the of presume the vice it when the that bill and it now think marriage is sacred institution going to be respectful for people who may disagree with me had record of doing so in the state of texas been person that had been uniter not divider because accept other people of view feel strongly that marriage should be between man and woman vice agree with that and did support that law think that we should find way to allow some kind of civic and basically agree with dick cheney and joe think the three of us have one view and the another view that right not sure what kind of view he to me can just tell you person who other people respect their respect on the one hand he he with me and then he he not sure where he coming from will be tolerant person been tolerant person all my life just happen to believe strongly that marriage is between man and woman you believe in general that and should have the same as other don think they ought to have special but think they ought to have the same there law pending the strongly support it it is that and can be fired from their job because they re gay or it would be federal law that wonder if the it been blocked by the in the majority in the wonder if the who lend his support to that law the question but it logical response have no idea mean he can throw out all don know the of this law will tell you the kind of person don hire or fire somebody based upon their sexual orientation as matter of fact would like to take the issue little further don really think it any of my you know any of my what how you conduct your sex life think that private matter think that the way it ought to be going to be respectful for people tolerate people and support equal but not special for people how does that affect and it would be if they re given special protective status mean we fully enforce and fully protect people and fully honor people which will do as the of the subject new question vice do you see the connection between gun in this country and the incidence of death by accidental or intentional use of jim hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and have very different view than the one he expressed that been said believe that well first of all let me say that the governor and agree on some where this subject is concerned will not do anything to affect the of or think that have to be and their right to have gun if they wish to the problem see is that there are too many getting into the of and and people who for whatever reason some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get think these assault are problem favor the gun show loophole fact cast the tie breaking vote to close it but then the majority in the of went the other way still pending we could get agreement on that maybe they could pass that in the final days of this think we ought to restore the three day waiting period under the think we should toughen the enforcement of gun so that the that are already on the can be enforced much more effectively of the that have been by the in the last couple of think in the last few think have been unfortunate think that we ought to make all gun free gun free zone around every school in this country think that like these are important safety trigger on mandatory basis and it with law you say loud and clear to somebody if you re going to carry gun illegally we re going to arrest you you re going to sell gun illegally you need to be you commit crime with gun there needs to be absolute certainty in the law that that the local law enforcement need help at the federal level like where the federal government arresting people who illegally use we haven done very good job of that at the federal level recently going to make it priority don think we ought to be selling to people who have them why support instant background at gun of the we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have gun or not texas tried to do something innovative lot of talk about trigger being on sold in the future support that said if you want trigger lock to make your gun safe come and get one for free we re in our state of texas for free think we ought to raise the age at which juvenile can carry handgun from to disagree with the vice president on this issue is for registration of think the only people that are going to show up to register or get license guess like driver license for gun the only people that are going to show up are law abiding the criminal is not going to show up and say hey give me my card the law abiding who will do that don think that is going to be an effective tool to make the keep our society safe right on somebody to cast vote based on your where are the not for registration am for by of new handgun that mean photo license like driver license for new and you know the me you would have to get the license photo to go in and before you could buy the gun right would issue the the state the state think should do that for new because too many are getting was recent investigation of the number in texas who got who were given concealed in spite of the fact that they had the spent lot of ink going into that am not for doing anything that would affect or do think that sensible gun safety are warranted now this is the year this is in the aftermath of columbine and and all the in our country where the nation been by these in the of the wrong people the woman who bought the for the two who did that killing at columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out form there she would not have bought those conceivably could have that tragedy to the question about the on gun control are they from your point of view between you and the vice not for photo me say something about columbine we got gun we ought to have gun free that sure every state in the union got them can carry gun into school there ought to be consequence when you do carry gun into school columbine spoke to issue really matter of culture culture that somewhere along the line we begun to disrespect life child can walk in and have their heart turned dark as result of being on the and walk in and decide to take somebody else life gun are important no question about it but so is loving and character education classes and faith based being part of after school desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say we love you there this is society that of ours that got to do better job of teaching right from wrong we can enforce law there to be lot of preoccupation on not certainly only in this debate but just in general on law there law your neighbor like you would like to be yourself that where our society must head if we re going to be peaceful and prosperous society also believe in the agree with lot of the other that the governor said do have serious problem in our culture and have worked on the problem of violence in entertainment at worked on it longer than have feel very strongly about that if president will do something about that think that we think we have to start with better don think that we can ignore the role by mean the fact is that there even though no state them there are in some the reason it so difficult for to control that is because in recent there been flood of cheap that are so widely available that are finding ways to get of them think that if you look at the situation as it here in the to any other country in the world it to me pretty obvious that while we respect the of and we do need some common sense gun safety to stem this flood of that are getting into the wrong no question about that but there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law who like matter where the gun comes from it could be cheap gun expensive gun is something in this person head there is not going to be consequence in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice added re tough believe in tough love say if you get caught carrying gun you re automatically that what needs to happen got need to be like instant background that important question as was saying of you both of you have much about and health care for about the more than million younger who do not have health insurance right now would you do about that got plan to do something about that to make health care affordable and available this way there some who should be health care who choose not to some of the million of the healthy healthy young say never get sick therefore don need health care right now for those what think we need to do is to develop an investment type vehicle that would be an incentive for them to invest like medical with capacity other you say to youngster it will be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness but for the working that do want to have health care that can afford it couple of we need to do we need more community health put out money in my budget to expand community health all around the country are where people can get primary care and they re good re very important of the safety net of health care that you get rebate from the government if you re family of or less it scales down as you get higher that you can use to purchase health care in the private will be huge down payment for pretty darn good system you allow also allow convince to allow to allow the mother to match some of the health insurance money with it the pool power to make health care more affordable allow business like the federal of or the of or the to write association across jurisdictional so that small have got the capacity to have national to drive the cost of insurance down think that the very best way to go people it people it and it practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance vice one of my top jim to give every single child in the affordable health care within the next four would like to see eventually in this country some form of universal health care but not for government run system fact for shrinking the size of government want smaller and government have been in charge of this government project that reduced the size of government by more than people in the last several the budget plan that put out according to the again the way these are typically measured as percentage of the will bring government spending down to the level in want to proceed carefully to cover more people think we should start by greatly expanding the so child health insurance or program to give health insurance to every single child in this country think it intolerable that we have so many millions of without any health insurance it one of my top know that we have some on this sorry to tell you that you know there is record here texas out of the in health care in with health care for with health care and for with health care it is priority for me guarantee you not aware of any program well just leave it at that think it ought to be top priority did the are the vice president correct about texas of all let me say he not for government run health care system thought that exactly what he and mrs clinton and them fought for in was government run health care system was fortunately stopped in its we spend billion year on the uninsured in the state of texas rate of uninsured the percentage of uninsured in texas gone down while the percentage of uninsured in america gone up program got late start because our government only four out of every two mr vice may come as shock for somebody who been in washington for so long actually limited government can work in the second state in the union therefore the bill after our session in ended we an legislation in up over to the program for comparable our size we re them up as fast as any other state can quote all the you want but telling you we care about our people in texas spent lot of money to make sure people get health care in the state of texas and we re doing better job than they are at the national level for reducing uninsured he right don know about all these that he out but do know that speculate that the reason why he answer your question directly as to whether my were right the were right about texas dead last in with health insurance and out of for both and is because those are correct as for why it no expert on the texas but what my there tell me is that the governor opposed measure put forward by in the legislature to expand the number of that would be covered instead directed the money toward tax cut significant part of which went to wealthy declared the need for new tax cut for the oil in texas an emergency need and so the money was taken away from the program you don have to take my word for this is now federal judge opinion about the current management of this program the state of texas to do you should read that judge language about this believe there are million in texas who do not have health insurance of whom and maybe some of those have since gotten it but as of year ago of them were actually eligible for it but they sign up for it because of the that they had set up let the governor respond to that those correct his correct he trying to allege that hard hearted person and don care about he absolutely wrong spent billion year in the state of texas for uninsured people they get health care it not the most efficient way to get people health care want to remind you the number of uninsured in america during their watch can make any excuse he but the are that we re reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population as the percentage of the population is increasing nationally somehow the allegation that we don care and we re going to give money for this interest or that interest and not for in the state of texas is totally absurd me just tell you who the jury is the people of texas only been one governor ever to back to back four year and that was me was able to do so with lot of nearly of the hispanic vote about of the african american vote because people know conservative person and compassionate person he can throw all the of around just telling you our state comes together to do what is right come together both and me put that directly to you vice the reason you brought this up is it are you suggesting that those and that record will reflect the way will operate in this area of health insurance as president yes it not statement about his heart don claim to know his heart think he good person make no about that believe him when he that he good heart know enough about your story to admire lot of the that you have done as person think it about his let me tell you exactly why think that the choice he made to give tax cut for the oil and before this mean if you were the governor of state that was dead last in health care for and all of sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in its history you want to maybe use some of it to climb from to say or or something or maybe better would but here is why it directly relevant jim by his own budget his for spending on tax for the of the wealthy are more than the new spending that he made for health care and education and national defense all combined to his own it not question of his heart as far as know question of and you know me ask of all that simply not true what he just said of course secondly repeat to you is not true we spent the top receive as opposed to billion in new spending the top let talk about my tax plan the top will pay one third of all the federal income in return get one fifth of the because most of the tax go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder in stark contrast by the way to man who is going to leave million million out of tax relief just have different point of view totally different point of view only the right people ought to get tax relief believe everybody who ought to get tax relief me go back to texas for example for minute pay billion can emphasize to you how much bill that in place the bill finally came out at the end of the session re working hard to sign up re doing it faster than any other state our size comparable state re making really good progress our state lot about our priority is going to be the health of our have had eight to get something done in washington on the uninsured have not done it had eight to get something done on they have not got it done my case to the american people is if you re happy with inactivity stay with the horse the horse is up there now if you want change you need to get somebody that how to bring and together to get positive done for american question new subject vice on the environment your book you said quote must make the rescue of our environment the central principle for civilization and there must be transformation to save the planet you still feel that way do think that in this century we will soon see the of what global warming was study just few ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in people see the strange weather that the old say they never seen before in their what happening is the level of pollution is increasing significantly here is the good news jim we take the leadership role and build the new like the new of and trucks that is itching to build then we can create millions of good new by being first into the market with these new of and trucks and other of know the japanese are breathing down our on this re moving very rapidly because they know that it is fast growing world market of these other particularly in the world their pollution is much worse than anywhere else and their people want higher of living so they re looking for ways to satisfy their desire for better life and still reduce pollution at the same time think that holding onto the old ways and the old argument that the environment and the economy are in conflict is really outdated have to be bold have to provide leadership it true that we disagree on this the governor said that he think this problem is necessarily by people for the oil into the just become the city in the country texas is number one in industrial pollution have very different outlook tell you this will fight for clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy let me start with texas are big industrial state reduced our industrial waste by up more brown than any other administration in my state history of them water is cleaner now what brown field is to those who don follow this brown field is an abandoned industrial site that just idle in some of our urban people are willing to invest capital in the brown don want to do so for fear of lawsuit think we ought to have federal liability protection depending upon whether or not have been met the book you that vice wrote he also for taxing big energy in order to clean up the environment now that the energy are high guess he not those big energy right now believe we ought to fully fund the and to with half the money going to so can make the right for environmental quality think we need to have clean coal propose billion worth the way just found out the other day an interesting fact that there is national petroleum reserve right next to in that your administration up for exploration in that pristine area it was smart move because there gas up there need gas to bring the gas down is clean fuel that we can burn to we need to make sure that if we decontrol our that there mandatory that the must conform to clean air the that what we did in texas no must conform other there are practical we can do it with working in collaborative effort with and local you own the land every day is care lot about their land and care about their environment all wisdom is in washington on this issue do you see the basic difference in very simple in two or three between you and the governor on the environment voter to make choice what is it really strongly to clean water and clean air and cleaning up the new of like global warming is right that not in favor of energy am in favor of tax to encourage and give for the development of these new of let me say again is to go on that differ on the as have said differ on whether or not pollution ought to be voluntary don think you can don think you can get that way differ on the of that we would make you say it fundamental difference think it fundamental difference me give you an example on one second sure about supply just want to know for somebody we re getting close to the end of our time here somebody to vote on the environment how would you draw the don believe in command and control out of washington believe washington ought to set but again think we ought to be collaborative at the local and think we ought to work with people at the local by the way just want to make sure can let him just say something and not correct it the electric decontrol bill that fought for and in texas mandatory emission mr vice what we ought to do at the federal level when it comes to for think there difference think for example take when they took million of land out of circulation without consulting local thought that was was out in the west in the west yeah so on the logging issue not the way would have done it some of that land needs to be set aside certainly would have with and before would have unilaterally you believe the federal government still some new and new and new to pass in the environmental area or do you think absolutely so long as they re based upon science and they re reasonable long as people have input about global warming think it an issue that we need to take very seriously don think we know the solution to global warming yet don think we got all the before we make tell you one thing not going to do is not going to let the carry the burden for cleaning up the world air would have done and india were from that treaty think we need to be more even handed as evidently think it was that position warming the did turn it down think to nothing that vote exactly lot of the of the actually ended up voting for that because the way it was worded there no doubt there lot of opposition to it in the not for command and control either for working with the not just with industry but also with the citizen and local to control sprawl in ways that the local themselves come up with disagree that we don know the cause of global warming think that we do pollution carbon dioxide and other that are even more potent but in smaller that cause this the world temperature is going up weather are are getting more violent and unpredictable are we going to tell our grandfather now want to be able to tell my grandson when in my later that turn away from the evidence that that we were doing some serious harm my faith tradition it is it written in the book of matthew your heart is there is your treasure also believe that that we ought to recognize the value to our and of taking that preserve the environment in way that good for them agree just think there been some of the believe mr vice haven they been their opinion little bit on global warming profound scientist recently made different of you have now excuse me of you have now your own that thought been trying so hard not to know know under your you are not to ask each other question let you do it moment ago you just twice sorry an interruption by the way an interruption anyhow you just did it so now sorry apologize mr vice to do that either see sorry go ahead and finish your thought care about these found out course they care about them you mean the right exactly right ahead the heck of course there lot look global warming needs to be taken very seriously and take it seriously science there lot there before we react think it best to have the full accounting full understanding of what taking place think to answer your question think both of us care lot about the environment may have different may have different in of how we deal with local just an example of the administration just unilaterally acting without any input remember you gave very good answer to hampshire about the about how it was important to keep that collaborative effort in place feel very strongly the same place certainly the attitude that took place out west however question question for you this somewhat out of the boston debate your running mate your campaign have that vice and the you do you believe these are serious is serious issue that the should use in which one of you two men to vote for on november we all make been known to mangle syllable or two myself you know if you know what mean think credibility is important is going to be important for the president to be credible with important for the president to be credible with foreign yes think it something that people need to consider something new read report or memo from somebody in his campaign forgot the fellow name warning then to be careful about exaggerating thought during his debate with bradley saying he the when it happen mention the last debate the sorry all right lot of from guy who not from washington it he and yet he so think this is an issue found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package thought there was some about the the people are going to have to make up their mind on this issue am going to continue to defend my record and defend my against what think are like for example only of receive under my reform package what he said the other day and that simply not the case have every right in the world to defend my record and what are about and that what are about vice got some of the wrong last week in some of the that used jim and sorry about that going to try to do better of the regret it is that getting detail wrong several times with the point that was trying to make many days that young girl in florida stood in her classroom however long even if it was only one day change the fact that there are lot of overcrowded in america and we need to do something about that are who pay more for their than lot of other people more than their sometimes sometimes than people in foreign we need to do something about that with the measure that leaves the majority of them without any real basic help until the next president term of four is over right away that doing it under the program can promise that will never get another detail wrong can promise you that will try not to and hard will promise you this with all the confidence in my heart and in the world that will do my best if president work my heart out to get the big right for the american people that resolve the issue going to be up to the people it it resolve it for you on what he in the future in the campaign are saying some awful hope they re not awful think they may be the man own what mean is calling him serial exaggerator don believe used those no but your campaign they have your campaign have your campaign mr vice are now calling the governor bumbler minute mean my point is should this is this don use language like that and don think that we should in your commercial understand the haven seen that in my haven seen the commercial think that what think the point of that is that anybody would have hard time trying to make tax cut plan that is so large that would put us into such big that almost half the to the of the wealthy think anybody would have hard time explaining that clearly in way that sense to the average person the kind of exaggeration was just talking about the one trouble explaining it it time to go to the vice you have two jim one of the that would like to close with in my statement is education because it an example of the overall approach that think is important race is about it about change it about giving to the american people education is my number one priority because think that it the most important big major change that we can bring in our country agree with that we should have new accountability testing of think that we should require to test all test and school and think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new also the difference is that while my plan with new accountability and local control it stop there want to give new to send their to college with tax deduction for college tuition per child per year want to reduce the size of the in this country for one basic reason so that can get more one on one time with the way to do that is first to recruit more plan in my budget to recruit new highly qualified and to help local school build new think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and school here is how that with all the rest of what we been talking about you have if you squander the surplus on huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top then you can make education the top priority the tax cut is your number one two three and four priority you can do education can do both have to choose choose education and health care the environment and retirement security and ask for your support two jim thank you very much mr vice thank you very much and would like to thank the here at and want to thank you all for listening running to get some done for america too many left unresolved been too much finger pointing and too much name calling in washington would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the and of the future want to have an education system that high local control of and strong accountability no child should be left behind in america want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace worry about morale in today military the warning are clear is time to have new commander in chief who will rebuild the military pay our men and more make sure they re better and have mission for our military and for all want to do something about issue been too long on the table because it been political issue time to bring together to say that all will get prescription drug coverage want to do something about an important priority because now is the time to act and we re going to say to our our we made to you will be kept younger in order to make sure the system tomorrow younger ought to be able to take some of your own money and invest it in safe to get better rate of return on that money finally do believe in tax relief believe we can set our don believe like the vice president does in huge government believe in limited government limited government and government we can send some of the money back to the people who pay the want to have tax relief for all people who pay the in america because think you can spend your money more wisely than the federal government can you for listening for your vote and god bless we will return next tuesday night october from washington in louis for the third and final debate you vice you next week for now from winston jim thank you and good night october the kerry evening from arizona state in tempe arizona bob of want to welcome you to the third and last of the between george and john kerry as jim told you before the first one these are by the on the topic will be domestic but the format will be the same as that first debate moderate our discussion under detailed agreed to by the but the and the to be covered were chosen by me have not told the or anyone else what they are refresh your memory on the will ask question the candidate is two to answer opponent then minute and half to offer rebuttal my discretion can extend the discussion by offering each candidate an additional green light will come on to signal the candidate left yellow light left red light five left is also buzzer if it is the may not question each other directly are no opening but there will be two minute is an audience here tonight but they have agreed to remain silent except for right now when they join me in welcoming george and john kerry welcome to you both coin toss the first question goes to kerry want to set the stage for this discussion by the question that think over all of our politics today and is probably on the of many people watching this debate tonight that is will our and ever live in world as safe and secure as the world in which we grew up first of all bob thank you for tonight you arizona state for welcoming us thank you to the for undertaking this enormous task re to be here mr glad to be here with you again to share and with the american people will we ever be safe and secure again absolutely must be the goal how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it believe that this president regrettably rushed us into war made about foreign policy away as result america is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be the measurement is not we the measurement is we as safe as we ought to be there are host of that this president had available to him like making sure that at all our in america are percent of them percent come in today uninspected not good enough who fly on today the cargo hold is not rayed but the baggage is not good enough don have enough in them are being cut from the streets of america because the president decided to cut the program we can do better job of homeland security can do better job of more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the will hunt them down and we kill them we capture them do whatever is necessary to be safe pledge this to you america will do it in the way that franklin roosevelt and ronald and john and did where we build the where the world together where we have the best intelligence and where we are able ultimately to be more safe and secure mr you have you very much want to thank arizona state as well we can be safe and secure if we stay on the offense against the and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world have got comprehensive strategy to not only chase down the al wherever it and we re making progress three quarters of al have been brought to justice but to make sure that that harbor are to account as result of ourselves and ridding the out of the afghan people had this weekend the first voter was year old woman think about that is on the march to account terrorist regime in other in order to make sure we re secure there must be comprehensive plan opponent just this weekend about how terrorism could be reduced to nuisance it to prostitution illegal gambling think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous don think you can secure america for the long run if you don have comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people home we do everything we can to protect the homeland the homeland security bill to better align our assets and opponent against it re doing everything we can to protect our and absolutely we can be secure in the long run just good strong leadership to add kerry the president had an opportunity to capture or kill bin he took his focus off of them the job to afghan and bin after he said bin must be caught dead or alive this president was is bin said don know don really think about him very much not that concerned need president who stays deadly on the real war on terror mr just don think ever said not worried about bin kind of one of those course we re worried about bin re on the hunt after bin re every asset at our disposal to get bin opponent said this war is matter of intelligence and law enforcement no this war is matter of every asset at our disposal to keep the american people question mr to you are talking about protecting ourselves from the unexpected but the flu season is suddenly upon us of people every year we find ourselves with severe shortage of flu vaccine did that happen bob we upon company out of to provide about half of the flu for the citizen and it turned out that the vaccine they were was so we took the right action and allow medicine into our country re working with canada to hopefully that they produce help us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our have got flu during this upcoming season call to our fellow is if you re healthy if you re younger don get flu shot this year us those who need to get the flu shot the elderly and the young the responsible for health in the is setting those and is the flu vaccine accordingly haven gotten flu shot and don intend to because want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get have problem with litigation in the of america are worried about getting and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine of the such strong believer in legal reform is so that people afraid of product that is necessary for the health of our and then end up getting in court of law the best thing we can do now bob given the with the company in is for those of us who are younger and healthy don get flu shot kerry really the problem with the american health care system not working for the american family it gotten worse under over the course of the last million have lost their health insurance in this country got about million right here in arizona just shy who have no health insurance at all lost their health insurance under watch in arizona have no health insurance at all across our country go to ohio million have no health insurance of them lost it under lost it under president turned his back on the wellness of america there is no system fact it starting to fall apart not because of though they are problem and john and are to fixing them but because of the issue that we don cover across our country don have health care re the country on the face of the planet the only nation in the world not to do it have plan to cover all re going to make it affordable and accessible re going to let everybody buy into the same health care plan and give themselves mr would you like to add something would you want to remind people listening tonight that plan is not litany of and plan is not to lay out that you can pay for just said he everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that and get the government per family every family in america up like the senator if would cost us trillion over an empty promise bait and switch up you it not an empty promise really interesting because the president used that very plan as reason for to accept his prescription drug plan said if it good enough for the and to have choice ought to have choice we do is we have choice choose other choose other the fact is we re going to help be able to buy into it those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves re not giving this away for nothing right kerry new question talk about economic security during the last debate that you would not raise on those making less than year the price of everything is going up and we all know it care as you are talking about is the cost of the war question is how can you or any president whoever is next time keep that pledge without running this country into debt and passing on more of the that we re running up to our tell you exactly how can do it by what took away which is pay as you go the we had pay as you go you were going to pass something in the you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how taken he the only president in history to do this also the only president in to lose million lost the only president to have of go down for the last three the only president to see go down the only president to see the level of business investment in our country as it is today going to reverse that going to change that re going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the plan that have laid out my health care plan my plan for education my plan for to be able to get better college shown exactly how going to pay for those we start we don do it exclusively but we start by rolling back george unaffordable tax cut for the people people earning more than year and we pass hopefully the kerry which some billion that we can get shut the loophole which american actually the loss of their own job just an expansion of that loophole in the last few days billion of to the oil and gas industry and the people ceiling from going to stand up and fight for the american worker am going to do it in way that fiscally sound show how pay for the health care how we pay for the education have credit pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas raise the student pay for it by the relationship with the president never once one bill the first president in hundred not to do that mr his rhetoric match his record been senator for to increase times they tried to reduce he against that times about being fiscal conservative or fiscally sound but he over he times to waive the budget which would have cost the trillion about tell you what when you re senator from when you re colleague of ted pay go pay and he goes ahead and trillion of new spending and yet the so tax on the rich which is also tax on many small business in america million by our account billion billion by his account is tax gap guess who usually up filling the tax gap the middle class propose detailed budget bob sent up my budget man to the and he here how we re going to reduce the deficit in half by five pro growth that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the of go to new question mr let continue on know there are all kind of statistics out there but want to bring it down to an individual mr what do you say to someone in this country who lost his job to someone overseas who being fraction of what that job here in the say bob got to continue to grow our economy and create the of the century here some help for you to go get an education some help for you to go to community college expanded trade adjustment assistance want to help pay for you to gain the necessary to fill the of the century know there lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing talk about fiscal perhaps the best way to keep here in america and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works went to washington to solve saw problem in the public education system in america were just shuffling too many through the system year after year grade after grade without learning the so we said raise the re spending more money but let raise the and measure early and solve now before it too late no education is how to help the person who lost job is how to make sure we got that productive and competitive four more got more to do to continue to raise to continue to reward and school that are working to emphasize math and science in the to continue to expand to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with college diploma so the person you to say here some help here some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go community college in your neighborhood community college which is providing the necessary to fill the of the century that what would say to that person kerry want you to notice how the president switched away from and talking about education principally me come back in one moment to that but want to speak for second if can to what the president said about fiscal responsibility by the president on fiscal responsibility is little bit like tony talking to me about law and order in this country president taken trillion surplus and turned it into as far as the eye can see care for the average american have gone up percent have gone up percent gasoline up percent went up percent few days ago prescription are up percent year guess what america the wages of have gone down the that are being in arizona right now are paying about less than the that we re losing the president just on by this problem the fact is that he cut job training money billion was cut only added little bit back this year because it an election year cut the and the to help be able to go to college cut the training money wound up not even extending unemployment and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed going to do those because that what right in america to transition in every respect question to you kerry two it still on know many say that president really have much control over for example if someone machine that does the work of five people that progress not the president fault ask you is it fair to blame the administration entirely for this loss of don blame them entirely for it blame the president for the the president could do that an impact on it is going to happen acknowledged that in union across the country had shop stand up and say will you promise me you re going to stop all this them in the eye and said no can do that can promise you is that will make the field as fair as possible that will for instance make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as worker in america are not the loss of your job if you re an american business you actually get benefit for going overseas get to defer your if you re looking at competitive world you say to yourself do better overseas than do here in america not smart don want american the loss of their own job when president we re going to shut that loophole in and we re going to use that money to lower corporate tax in america for all percent we re going to have credit and job credit so we actually help people be able to hire here the second thing that we can do is provide fair trade field president stand up for when was international and discovered during the course of this campaign after been talking about it for the fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on for currency manipulation are that to petition the administration were told don even bother we re not going to listen to it the fact is that there have been shut to us that we haven stood up and fought for going to fight for fair trade field for the american worker will fight for the american worker just as hard as fight for my own job what the american worker if we do that we can have an impact we need fiscal discipline fiscal discipline we do lot better mr me start with the his last litany of said we cut by million fact know he to the me talk to the got more money in your pocket as result of the tax relief we and he opposed you have child you got child credit money in your pocket you re married we reduced the marriage penalty the code ought to encourage marriage not discourage marriage percent bracket to help lower income family of four making received about in tax relief your money the way my opponent he said re going to spend the government money no we re spending your money when you have more money in your pocket you re able to better afford you want believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our to help them realize their not tell how to live their opponent about fiscal sanity record in the does not match his rhetoric to increase times and to bust the budget times kerry bob anybody can play with these that have or for tax over times broke with my party in order to balance the budget and ronald into law the tax cut that we for for tax for small business tax you know why the have gone up in their more people qualify for them because they don have money they re not getting the the president them re getting less money have more people who qualify not what we want no one with your to increase times they when they reducing you against it times to violate the budget cap times know there main stream in american politics and you sit right on the far left bank as matter of fact your record is such that ted your colleague is the conservative senator from mr let get back to economic let shift to some other here of you are opposed to gay marriage to understand how you have come to that conclusion want to ask you more basic question you believe homosexuality is choice know bob don know just don know do know that we have choice to make in america and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity important that we do that also know in free society people consenting can live the way they want to live that to be as we respect someone and as we profess tolerance we change or have to change our basic on the sanctity of marriage believe in the sanctity of marriage think it very important that we protect marriage as an institution between man and woman constitutional amendment the reason did so was because was worried that activist are actually the definition of marriage and the way to protect marriage between man and woman is to amend the also the benefit of to participate in the process all when you amend the state must participate in the ratification of the deeply concerned that are making those and not the citizenry of the know law the of opponent was against it basically from the action of one state to another also defined marriage as between man and woman concerned that that will get if it then we end up with marriage being defined by and don think that in our nation kerry re all god bob think if you were to talk to dick cheney daughter who is she would tell you that she being who she was she being who she was born as think if you talk to anybody it not choice met people who with this for people who were in marriage because they were living sort of convention and they with it met who are supportive of their or vice when they finally sort of broke out and themselves to live who they were who they felt god had made them think we have to respect that the president and share the belief that marriage is between man and woman believe that believe marriage is between man and woman also believe that because we are the of america we re country with great unbelievable with that we afford people that you can discriminate in the workplace can discriminate in the that you afford people can disallow someone the right to visit their partner in hospital have to allow people to transfer property which is why for partnership and so forth with respect to and the marriage the have always been able to manage those they re proving today every state that they can manage them adequately kerry new question for you the that some are telling their church that it would be sin to vote for candidate like you because you support woman right to choose an abortion and unlimited stem cell research is your reaction to that respect their completely respect their am grew up learning how to respect those disagree with them as do many believe that can legislate or transfer to another american citizen my article of faith is an article of faith for me is not something that can legislate on somebody who share that article of faith believe that choice is woman choice between woman god and her doctor that why support that will not allow somebody to come in and change wade the president never said whether or not he would do that we know from the people he tried to appoint to the court he to will not will defend the right of wade with respect to religion you know as said grew up was an altar boy know that throughout my life this made difference to me as said when he ran for president he said not running to be president running to be president who to be faith everything that do in truth great passage of the bible that does it mean my brother to say you have faith if there are no without works is dead think that everything you do in public life to be by your faith affected by your faith but without transferring it in any official way to other people why fight against poverty why fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth why fight for equality and justice of those come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith know this that in his inaugural address told all of us that here on god work must truly be our own that what we have to think that the test of public service mr think it important to promote culture of life think hospitable society is society where every being and every person believe the ideal world is one in which every child is in law and to life understand there great on this issue of abortion but believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of for example the ban on partial birth abortion brutal practice from both political came together in the of and overwhelmingly to ban that practice made lot of sense opponent in that he out of the against that law saying is is that as we promote life and promote culture of life surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of continue to promote adoption it great alternative to abortion continue to fund and promote maternity group will continue to promote abstinence the last debate my opponent said his wife was involved with those great appreciate that very much of us ought to be involved with that provide viable alternative to abortion mr let have new question goes to you let get back to economic insurance have risen over percent over the last four according to the washington re paying more re getting less would like to ask you responsibility for this it the government it the insurance it the it the it the administration sure hope it not the administration no look there systemic problem care are on the rise because the are not involved in the decision making process health care are covered by third therefore the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care there no market involved with health care one of the strong believer in what they call health are that allow somebody to buy low premium high deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax free can contribute can contribute on contractual basis this is way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision making process on health care do believe the don believe know that the are causing health care to rise in america why such strong believer in medical liability reform the last debate my opponent said those only the cost to go up by percent he include the defensive practice of medicine that the federal government some billion year and our society between billion and billion year one of the why there still high cost in medicine is because this is they don use any information technology like if you at the it the equivalent of the buggy and horse days to other here in america so we got to introduce high technology into health care re beginning to do it re the language want there to be electronic medical to cut down on error as well as reduce cost tell me that when the health care field is fully with information technology it wring some percent of the cost out of the system finally moving generic to the market so those are four ways to help control the in health care kerry the reason health care are getting higher one of the principal is that this administration stood in the way of common sense that would have reduced the me give you prime example the we the right of to import from canada the president and his took it out in the and now you don have that right the president blocked you from the right to have less expensive from canada also to be able to negotiate bulk the does that the lower cost to our could have done that in is for by the american taxpayer to you is for who many of them are on fixed income to lift them out of poverty rather than help you the taxpayer have lower cost rather than help have less expensive the president made it illegal illegal for to actually go out and bargain for lower billion windfall profit to the drug coming out of your large part of your percent increase in president sending that back to and we re going to get real prescription drug benefit we also have people sicker because they don have health insurance whether it diabetes or cancer they come to later and it america more got to have health care for all ahead mr think it important since he about the plan he been in the for no record on of health care no record at all some and he five no record of leadership came to washington to solve was deeply concerned about to choose between prescription and food so led in our will get prescription drug coverage in kerry again the president is misleading america actually individual that personally written and in addition to that and not always under my name there is on certain more importantly with respect to the question of no record write did write was one of the original of the early childhood health care and the expansion of health care that we did in the middle of the very of that the president wrong me direct the next question to you kerry and again let stay on health care have as you have and as the president on tonight massive plan to extend health care coverage to re also talking about the government up big part of the catastrophic that people get at the hospital you have said that you can pay for this by rolling back the president tax cut on the upper percent the president say tonight that it going to cost whole lot more money than that just ask you where are you going to get the money two leading national news have both said the president characterization of my health care plan is incorrect it fiction the other it untrue the fact is that my health care plan america is very simple you the choice don force you to do anything not government plan the government require you to do anything choose your doctor choose your plan you don want to take the offer of the plan that want to put forward you don have do can keep what you have today keep high deductible keep high keep high pay keep low got better plan don think lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today what do take over from the so that every child in america is covered in exchange if the want to they re not forced to they can choose to they cover up to percent of poverty their choice think they choose it because it net plus of billion to them allow you if you choose to you don have to but we give you competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that and give themselves it good enough for us it good enough for every american believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in washington want to buy into it you can give you competition lower addition to that we re going to allow people to to buy into early most importantly we give small business percent tax credit so that after we lower the of health care they also get whether they re self employed or small business lower cost to be able to cover their what is when you begin to get people covered like that for instance in diabetes if you diagnose diabetes early you could save billion in the health care system of america by surgery and dialysis works going to offer it to america mr all due respect not so sure it credible to quote leading news about oh never mind let me quote the report the report is group of who are not politically the senator plan cost trillion the report accurately noted that there are going to be million people over million people added to government health care would be the increase in government health care ever you raise the to percent it an incentive for small not to provide private insurance to their should they insure somebody when the government going to insure it for them that million people will go from private insurance to government insurance have fundamental difference of opinion think government run health will lead to poor quality health will lead to will lead to less choice health care program up in line item in the federal government budget it to more just look at other that have tried to have federally health care have poor quality health care health care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the are made by and not by in the nation capital the president just said that government run health care in poor quality maybe that why he fully funded the and the hospital is trouble and are that why are about being off of adequately fund it let me just say to america am not government run program not what have have and have wide choice ought to have it too mr about the by billion in the four since been president twice the amount that my predecessor course we re meeting our obligation to our and the know that re expanding health care throughout the country re where the live now are getting very good health care under my administration and they will continue to do so during the next four mr the next question is to you all know that is running out of money and it to be fixed have to fix it by people put some of the money collected to pay into private the are saying that going to mean finding trillion over the next to continue paying as those are being set up where do you get the money you going to have to increase the deficit by that much over let me make sure that every senior listening today that when we re talking about that they still get their remember the campaign people said if george your check will be taken away people got their and they continue to get their is problem for our real problem if we don act today the problem will be valued in the so think we need to think differently honor our commitment to our for our and our we need to have different strategy that together group of our fellow to study the issue was committee by the late daniel patrick of they came up with variety of for people to look at believe that younger ought to be to take some of their own money and put it in personal account because understand that they need to get better of return than the of return being given in the current trust the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the system is solvent for our and our will work with and be vital issue in my second term is an issue that am willing to take on and so bring and together we re of course going to have to consider the want to warn my fellow the cost of doing nothing the cost of saying the current system is far the of trying to make sure we save the system for our kerry just the president say that young people ought to be able to take money out of and put it in their own my fellow that an invitation to disaster the said very clearly that if you were to adopt the president plan there would be trillion hole in because today pay in to the system for today the said that the it bipartisan they said that there would have to be cut in of percent to percent the president never to america ever done it tonight where does the transitional money that trillion come from already got trillion according to the washington of that he put on the line from his convention and the of this campaign none of which are for one of them are for the fact is that the president is driving the in american history broken the pay as you go have record of fighting for fiscal responsibility was one of the first broke with my party balanced the budget in the down the debt for two that what we re going to do re going to protect will not it will not cut the we re going to be fiscally responsible we will take care of me just stay on with new question for kerry because kerry you have just said you will not cut alan the chairman of the federal there no way that can pay what we have them unless we recalibrate he suggesting we re going to cut or we re going to have to raise the retirement age may have to take some other reform if you just said you no does that mean you re just going to leave this as problem another problem for our to solve at all not bob is the same thing we remember on the with tim in something the same thing fixed it fact we put together trillion surplus in the that was for the purpose of saving you take the tax cut that the president of the given gave to in the top percent of america just that tax cut that went to the top percent of america would have saved until the year the president decided to give it to the in tax cut alan who think done terrific job in monetary policy the president tax cut don support it for the middle class not that part of it that goes to people earning more than year when roll it back and we invest in the that have about to move our economy we re going to grow sufficiently it would begin to cut the deficit in half and we get back to where we were at the end of the when we balanced the budget and down the debt of this country we can do that if later on after period of time we find that is in trouble we pull together the top of the country do exactly what we did in the we make whatever adjustment is necessary the first and most important thing is to start in america the the president is pay less than the that we re losing this is the first president in to preside over an economy in america that lost million other six and five had had had great none of them lost the way this president have plan to put america back to work if we re fiscally responsible and put america back to work we re going to fix mr forgot to tell you he to tax more than one time hear any plan to fix more of the same about middle class tax exactly where the tax went of the tax went to low and middle income now the tax code is more fair percent of the upper income people pay about percent of the in america today because of how we structured the tax listening out there know the of the tax we you have child you got tax relief you re married you got tax relief you pay any tax at all you got tax relief of which was opposed by my opponent the tax relief was important to spur consumption and investment to get us out of this recession need to remember prior to my arrival the stock market to go down it was one of the in our history then we had recession and we got which cost us million we led the tax relief now this economy is growing added million new over the last there more work to do the way to make sure our economy is not to raise on small business not to increase the scope of the federal government to make sure we have fiscal sanity and keep low go to new question mr got more mail this week on this question than any other question it is about immigration told that at least people cross our illegally every day people believe this is security issue as you know believe it an economic issue see it as human issue do you see it what do we need to do about it see it as serious problem see it as security issue see it as an economic issue and see it as human issue re increasing the border security of the got more on the southern border re new equipment re unmanned to spot people coming across we continue to do so over the next four subject very familiar with all was border governor for while people are coming to this country for economic re coming here to work you can make in the heart of for example or make here in america you re going to come here if you re worth your salt if you want to put food on the table for your that what happening so in order to take pressure off the in order to make the more secure believe there ought to be temporary worker card that willing worker and willing employer to mate up so long as there not an american willing to do that job to join up in order to be able to fulfill the needs the benefit of making sure our breaking the law as they try to fill their needs sure that the people coming across the border are humanely that they re not kept in the of our society that they re able to go back and forth to see their the card it have period of time attached to it also it pressure off the border somebody is coming here to work with card it they re not going to have to sneak across the border our border patrol will be more likely to be able to focus on doing their job it very important for our to also know that don believe we ought to have amnesty don think we ought to reward illegal behavior are plenty of people standing in line to become citizen we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line they want to become citizen they can stand in line too here is where my opponent and differ september he amnesty for illegal up me just answer one part of the last question quickly and then come to immigration the american middle class family making it right now bob what the president said about the tax been out by the increase in health care the increase in gasoline the increase in the increase in prescription the fact is the take home pay of typical american family as share of national income is lower than it been since the take home pay of the percent of is the highest it been since the middle class seen their tax burden go up and the tax burden gone down that wrong with respect to immigration reform the president broke his promise on immigration reform said he would reform it later he is now promising another plan what do one the are more today than they were before the fact is we haven done what we need to do to toughen up our and will we need guest worker program but if it all we have it not going to solve the problem the second thing we need is to crack down on illegal against the law in the to hire people illegally and we ought to be that law properly thirdly we need an legalization program for people who have been here for long time stayed out of trouble got job their and their are american got to start moving them toward full citizenship out of the you want to respond mr to say that the are not as as they were prior to september the he know the re much better today than they were when was the governor of texas have much more and much more equipment there just understand how the work evidently to say that is an outrageous claim we continue to protect our re to increase and equipment thousand people day are coming across the border the fact is that we now have people from the allegedly coming across the border we re not doing what we ought to do in of the technology have iris identification technology have thumbprint fingerprint technology today can know who the people are that they re really the people they say they are when they cross the border could speed it up are huge the fact is our are not as secure as they ought to be and make them secure question to you kerry the gap between rich and poor is growing people are dropping into poverty the minimum wage been stuck at what an hour now for about seven it time to raise it glad you raised that question long overdue time to raise the minimum wage america this is one of those that separates the president and myself have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last the leadership of the and won even let us have vote on it re not to vote on it don want to raise the minimum wage the minimum wage is the minimum wage value it been in our nation in we raise the minimum wage which will do over several to an hour million who are trying to raise their would earn another year the president million year but he hesitate to fight for to millionaire percent of america got billion last year in tax cut but people working hard by the trying to take care of their family that we re supposed to value so much in america tired of who talk about family and don value we need to do is raise the minimum wage also need to hold on to equal pay work for on the dollar for the same work that men do not right in america we had an initiative that we were working on to raise pay cut it off stopped it don enforce these of think that it matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage million would be positively affected put money into the of people who work hard who obey the who play for the american dream if we did that we have more consumption ability in america which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage mitch had minimum wage plan that that would have the minimum wage let me talk about what really important for the worker you re to that to make sure the education system works to make sure we raise the no is really act when you think about it the no raise increase federal spending in return for extra spending we now want people to measure and local to measure to show us whether or not child can read or write or add and subtract cannot solve problem unless you diagnose the problem we therefore just were being through the school guess who would get through whose speak english as first language just move through inner city just move through stopped that practice now by measuring early when we find problem we spend extra money to correct it remember lady in texas told me is the new civil right and she right order to make sure people have for the century we got to get it right in the education system and we re beginning to close minority achievement gap now see we never be able to compete in the century unless we have an education system that quit on an education system that an education that sure there excellence in every classroom mr want to go back to something kerry said tonight and ask follow up of my own said and this will be new question to you he said that you had never said whether you would like to overturn wade ask you directly would you like to he me is will have litmus test for my the answer is no will not have litmus test will pick who will interpret the but have no litmus test kerry you like to respond that new question or second question new question for for time limit have you very much again the president answer the question answer it straight to america not going to appoint judge to the who going to undo constitutional right whether it the or the or some other right that given under our today under the believe that the right of choice is constitutional right don intend to see it undone the president to leave in ambivalence or to undo it let me go step further have long distance yet to travel in of fairness in america don know how you can govern in this country when you look at and you see that percent of the black there are unemployed when you see percent of hispanic of black in some dropping out of high school yet the president who about no to fully fund by billion that particular program so you can make difference in the of those young people right here in arizona that difference would have been million to the state of arizona to help its be able to have better education and to lift the property tax burden from its the president on his promise to fund no tell you he raised the money and he he put in what he and that difference in the of our sir he clearly litmus test for his which disagree with secondly only liberal senator from would say that percent increase in for education was not enough funds more importantly we reformed the system to make sure that we solve early before they re too late about the unemployed we got to make sure they get educated about whose don speak english as first language we got to make sure they get educated that what the no does don measure it by percentage increase mr you measure it by whether you re getting the job done hundred thousand lost after school because of your budget that not in my gut not in my value system and certainly not so that the people in america can walk away with another tax cut billion last year to the top percent of but lost their after school be the judge right let go to another question it is to kerry have two sir the last debate said he did not favor draft agreed with him our and are being severely strained because many of them are being beyond their of them say that it back door draft there any relief that could be to these brave and their you president kerry what would you do about this situation of holding and for these extended of time and these repeated call that they re now facing think the fact that they re facing these repeated call some of them two and three and there stop loss policy that people from being able to get out when their time was up is reflection of the bad judgment this president in how he engaged in the world and our military is out of active duty are either in iraq going to iraq or have come back from iraq way or the other they re wrapped up in it two active duty to the armed of the one combat one support addition going to double the number of so that we can fight more effective war on terror with less pressure on the and what would like to do is see the and be differently here in our own country much we can do with them with respect to homeland security ought to be doing that that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of the armed is frankly to run foreign policy that that america is when we are working with real when we are the of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest and our diplomacy to bring other to our side said it before say it again believe the president broke faith to the american people in the way that he took this nation to war said he would work through real alliance said in cincinnati we would plan carefully we would take every precaution we the result is our today are the fact is that he did not choose to go to war as last result america now is paying already billion up to billion before we re finished and much more probably that is the result of this president taking his eye off of bin mr the best way to take the pressure off our is to succeed in iraq is to train so they can do the hard work of democracy is to give them chance to defend their country which is precisely what we re doing have trained by the end of this year remember going on an airplane in maine to say thanks to the and that were headed overseas from and carolina georgia of them had been there before the people to their were high view their service as back door draft their service as an opportunity to serve their country opponent the senator about foreign policy our first debate he america pass global test order to defend ourselves we have to get international approval one of the major we have about our country work with allies work with continue to build strong will never turn over our national security to of other be resolute we be strong and we wage comprehensive war against the have never test where we turn over our security to any nation fact said the opposite will never turn the security of the over to any nation no nation will ever have veto over us think it sense think most in their know that we ought to pass sort of truth standard how you gain legitimacy with your own countrypeople and that how you gain legitimacy in the world never fail to protect the of america there was vast coalition put together to run out of the international community the international world said this is the right thing to do but when it came time to authorize the use of force on the floor my opponent against the use of force you can pass any test under his vision of the world mr new question two said that if would vote to extend the ban on assault that you sign the legislation but you did nothing to encourage the to extend it not made my made my clear did think we ought to extend the assault ban and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move because and were against the assault weapon ban people of both believe law abiding ought to be able to own gun believe in background at gun or anywhere to make sure that don get in the of people that have them the best way to protect our from is to prosecute those who commit with that why early in my administration the attorney general and the and said together task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit with the are up by about percent believe is the number are when we crack down on people who commit with me that the best way to secure america believe it was failure of presidential leadership not to reauthorize the assault ban am gun owner been since was old respect the and will not tamper with the tell you this also former law enforcement officer ran one of the district attorney in america one of the ten put people behind for the rest of their life broken up organized crime know something about most of the law enforcement in america that assault ban don want to go into drug bust and be facing an was hunting in iowa last year with sheriff from one of the there and he pointed to house in back of us and said the house over just did drug bust week and the guy we had an lying on the bed right beside him of the president decision today law enforcement will walk into place that will be more dangerous can now come into america and go to gun show and without even background check buy an assault weapon today that what bin handbook said because we it in them to do it believe america less safe tom or someone in the said to me we don have the have said we re going to have fight have taken it out to the country and have had every law enforcement officer in the country visit those have won what bill clinton won go to new question for you kerry two action you see need for affirmative action or have we far enough along that we no longer need to use race and gender as factor in school and federal and state and so on no bob regrettably we have not far enough along regret to say that this administration even blocked that could help us move further along give you an example on the for long time was chairman of it once the senior on it used to you know we have goal there for minority set aside to try to encourage ownership in the country don reach those don even fight to reach those tried to undo them the fact is that in too many of our country we still have discrimination affirmative action is not just something that to people of color people have mistaken view of it in america also is with respect to it with respect to other to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country think that we have long way to go regrettably you look at what we made progress want to say that at the same time the clinton as you may recall there was fight over affirmative action there were many people like myself who opposed who felt there were where it was overreaching we had policy it don end it fixed it we fixed it for reason because there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism and so we have distance to travel as president will make certain we travel it let me just share something president is the first president ever think not to meet with the is president who met with the is president who not met with the civil leadership of our country president reach out and bring people in and be inclusive then how are we going to get over those see that as part of my job as president and make my best effort to do it mr first of all it is just not true that haven met with the met with the at the secondly like my opponent don agree we ought to have agree we have we ought to have an aggressive effort to make sure people are educated to make sure when they get out of high school there available for them which is what we done expanded by million you realize today in america we spend billion to help million low and middle income better afford college the access believe is necessary is to make sure every child to read write add and subtract early to be able to build on that education by going to college so they can start their with college diploma believe the best way to help our small is not only through small business which we have since been the president of the but to unbundle government so people have chance to be able to bid and receive contract to help get their business going ownership of are up because we an environment for the entrepreneurial spirit to be strong believe part of hopeful society is one in which somebody something in america more own home than ever before that hopeful and that positive mr let go to new question were before the invasion or after the invasion of iraq if you checked with your dad believe don remember the quote exactly but believe you said you had checked with higher authority would like to ask you what part does your faith play on your policy my faith lot big part in my life that when was that question what was really saying to the person was that pray lot do my faith is very it very personal pray for strength pray for wisdom pray for our in harm way pray for my family pray for my little mindful in free society that people can worship if they want to or not re equally an american if you choose to worship an almighty and if you choose not to you re christian jew or you re equally an american the great thing about america is the right to worship the way you see fit and religion sustain me receive calmness in the of the presidency love the fact that people pray for me and my family all around the country me one time how do you know said just feel it is an important part never want to impose my religion on anybody else when make stand on principle and the are derived from who am believe we ought to love our neighbor like we love ourself as manifested in public policy through the faith based initiative where we unleashed the of compassion to help heal people who hurt believe that god everybody to be free what believe that been part of my foreign policy believe that the freedom there is gift from the can tell you how am to see freedom on the march so my that make on are part of me and religion is part of me kerry respect everything that the president said and certainly respect his faith think it important and share it think that he just said that freedom is gift from the is gift from the as measure the of the bible and we all do different people measure different the koran the or you know who gave me blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to higher being people all find their ways to express it was taught went to church school and was taught that the two are the lord your god with all your mind your body and your soul and love your neighbor as yourself frankly think we have lot more loving of our neighbor to do in this country and on this planet have separate and unequal school system in the of america one for the people who have and there one for the people who don have we re struggling with that today the president and have difference of opinion about how we live out our sense of our faith about it when about the works and faith without works being dead think we got lot more work to do as president will always respect everybody right to practice religion as they choose or not to practice because that part of america kerry after and this is new question for you it to me that the country came together as never seen it come together since some of that to have melted away think it fair to say we become pretty perhaps because of the political season if you were president or whoever is president will you set priority in trying to bring the nation back together what would be your attitude on that much so me pay compliment to the president if may think in those days after thought the president did terrific job really was as well as by the speech that he gave to the think the hug tom gave him at that moment was about as genuine sense of there being no no we were all just where we were not where we are today regret to say that the president who himself uniter not divider is now over the most divided america in the recent memory of our country never seen such ideological in the of the never seen of party locked out of the way they re locked out today have to change that as president am to that don care if the idea comes from the other side or this side think we have to come together and work to change it done that in the worked with john who sitting here worked with other across the aisle tried to find the common ground because that what us strong as if trust me with the presidency can pledge to you we will have the most significant effort openly not secret in the with special not ideologically driven to push people aside but genuine effort to try to restore america hope and by people together one of the ways we re going to do it is going to work with my friend john to further campaign finance reform so we get these incredible of money out of the system and open it up to average people so america is really by the people who make up america mr biggest disappointment in washington is how partisan the town is had record of working with and as the governor of texas and was hopeful be able to do the same thing we made good progress early on the no incredibly enough was good work between me and my administration and people like ted we worked together with to relieve the tax burden on the middle class and all who pay in order to make sure this economy to grow washington is tough town the way view it is there lot of special there people who are you know on one side of the issue or another and they spend enormous of money and they convince different to taut their way or different to talk about their issue and they dig in continue in the four to continue to try to work to do so opponent said this is bitterly divided time divided in the election in other it pretty divided during the as well re just in period we got to work to bring it my opponent john and glad he did john is for me for president because he have the right view in winning the war on terror and that my plan will succeed in iraq my opponent got plan of retreat and defeat in iraq come to our last question it to me as came to this debate tonight that the three of us share something three of us are surrounded by very strong re all married to strong of us have two that make us very like to ask each of you what is the most important thing you learned from these strong listen to them stand up straight and not scowl love the strong around me can tell you how much love my wife and our am you know it really interesting tell the people on the campaign trail when laura to marry me she said just so long as never have to give speech said you got deal she hold me to that deal she out along with our she english lot better than do think people understand what she saying they see compassionate strong great first lady in laura can tell you how lucky am met her in the at joe and jan in texas it was the classic barbecue said on over think you find somebody who might interest you said all right over there was only four of us there not only did she interest me guess you would say it was love at first sight kerry guess the president and you and are three of lucky people who married up some would say maybe me more so than can take it say if could just say word about woman that you ask about but my away couple ago just before was to run she was in the hospital and went in to talk to her and tell her what was thinking of doing she at me from her hospital bed and she just at me and she said integrity integrity integrity those are the three that she left me with my and my wife are people who just are filled with that sense of what right what wrong also kick me around keep me honest don let me get away with anything can sometimes take myself too seriously surely don let me do that blessed as think the president is blessed as said last time watched him with the first lady who admire great deal and his great father think we re both very lucky that us to the kerry believe you re first fellow as you from bob moment ago america is being tested by division than ever we need to be united as country like franklin roosevelt don care whether an idea is idea or idea just care whether it works for america and whether it going to make us are dangerous times believe offer tested strong leadership that can calm the of the world believe that we can together do that are within the grasp of can lift our up can create that pay more than the we re losing overseas can have health care for all can further the cause of equality in our nation me just make it clear will never allow any country to have veto over our security as fought for our country as young man with the same passion will fight to defend this nation that love with faith in god and with conviction in the mission of america believe that we can reach higher believe we can do better think the of our country our and our are out there just waiting for us to grab onto them ask you to embark on that journey with me ask you for your trust ask you for your help ask you to allow me the privilege of leading this great nation of ours of helping us to be here at home and to be again in the world and most of all to be forever you god bless the of america mr the there painting by friend of laura and mine by tom lee it texas painting painting of mountain scene he said this about it said sarah and live on the east side of the mountain the sunrise side not the sunset side the side to see the day that is coming not to see the day that is gone love the optimism in that painting because that how feel about america we been through lot together during the last come through recession stock market decline an attack on our country yet because of the hard work of the american people and good this economy is growing the next four we make sure the economy to grow reformed our school system and now there an achievement gap in america that beginning to close the next four we continue to insist on excellence in every classroom in america so that our have chance to realize the great promise of america the next four we continue to work to make sure health care is available and affordable the next four we continue to rally the of compassion to help heal the hurt that in some of our country optimistic that we win the war on terror but understand it firm resolve and clear purpose must never waver in the face of this enemy that these of hate as we pursue the enemy wherever it we also spread freedom and liberty got great faith in the ability of liberty to transform to convert hostile world to peaceful world hope for america is prosperous america hopeful america and world want to thank you for listening tonight for your vote god bless you you mr you kerry that these to close but the campaign goes on want to wish both of you the very best of luck between now and it for us from arizona state in tempe arizona bob at everyone guess this is more or less now just to get you up to date is what is meeting for me um eva and did you add more stuff to it later don know were like the you know and all that stuff thought you you said you were stuff but don know no is nice so we thought that can write up an element and for each of the situation that we in the net the situation like at the entity that is if we know anything about it it under construction is it on fire or something happening to it is it stable and so forth going all the way um through or is is situation are is all the which can be happening right now what is the situation type basically just the the input for the what see are you it in because it us to be specific about the here also mean this is what the input is going to be we will is schema is yeah just don know if this is th what the is what java as no because mean if we net spec mean we re sure interface to re get an document from somewhere that document will say are able to were able to observe that the element um of the that the car is that be this is the situational context everything in it that what is short for shi situational context this is just again an schemata which set of possible permissible which we view as input into the net then we can possibly run one of them put it into the format that the or java or whatever you talking are you talking about the the structure it mean when you observe node you when you say the input to the java it certain format right don think is this don know no it certainly not this you could just you just run convert it into the java for format no problem but even think that um mean once you have this sort of as running as module you want is say give me the posterior of the there node when this is happening the person said this the car is there it and this is happening with this you can specify the what happening in the situation and what happening with the user we get we are done through the we get the this is this is just specification of all the possible all the possible too we have um for example the there decision node which two going there and its posterior probability and not going there and its posterior probability because the output is always be all the decision and all the the all the posterior for all the then we would just look at the eh that we look at in of if if we re only about one of the like if just interested in the going there node would just pull that information out of the that return that would that java would output pretty much yes but think it little bit more complex as if understand it correctly it always you all the posterior for all the of all decision when we input something we always get the posterior for all of these there is no way of telling it not to tell us about the wait agree that yeah use oh so we get this whole list of of um and the question is what to do with it what to hand on how to interpret it in sense you said if you only interested in whether he to go there or not then just look at that node look which one at that in the output right at that in the the output even though call it well it an that being returned right every part of structure is just just was it to in my head and going with that element or object would say not what was trying to though yeah um the reason is why think it little bit more complex or why why we can even think about it as an interesting problem in and of itself is the look at an example we just take the structure that and then run another transformation on it that would just dump the one that we out need to prune away actually you don even need to do that with you just look at one specific no exactly the you to say give me the value of that and that and that we don really know what we re interested in before we look at the complete at at the overall result the person said um is and so we want to know um is he want on this or know the location does he want to go there assume this is our our question this in we get assume this is the output should con be able to conclude from that that mean always give us value of how likely we think it is that he to go there and want to go there or how likely it is that he to get information maybe we should just reverse this to make it little bit more delicate does he know where it is or does he go there to know where it is tend to agree if it now mean you could if there sort of clear winner here and um and this is pretty indifferent then we then we might conclude that he actually to just know where he does want to go there out of curiosity is there reason why we combine these three into one smaller that would just basically be the question for have where is is the question right would just be on or upon there lot of people ask that if they actually just go there come up to you on campus and say the library re say you re say down that way re not say five hundred away from you or north of you or it mean the there you just have three for the final node that would link these three in the net together don know whether understand what you mean in this this input we also in some may postulate an opinion whether that person to go there now the way use cab or so to know it to know where it is because he something fixed there because he to visit it or whatever it mean saying is whatever our input is we re always get the full output some some will always be sort of too not significant enough or it be tight won it be hard to decide mean guess guess the thing is this is another smaller case of reasoning in the case of an uncertainty which me think net should be the way to solve these if you had for every construction right you could say there the construction for the construction we know we need to look at this node that these three together as for th to decide the response since we have finite number of that we can deal with we could have finite number of if we had to deal with arbitrary language it make any sense to do that because there be no way to generate the for every possible sentence since we can only deal with finite amount of stuff basically the idea is to to feed the output of that belief net into another belief net so basically take these three and then put them into another belief net why why why only those three not the mean for the question we have node for the question we believe that all the decision are can be relevant for the and the do get to or the me something about food not in here can come in if you want it is as long as you re not wearing your your second be back do don know if this is good idea or not just throwing it out it like we could have or we could put all of the all of the information that could also be relevant into the node answer node thing stuff mean not forget we re get some very strong input from these sub dis from these discourse right me the location of is at know but the net would be able to the on the on the in the net would be able to do all that it wait until you re plugged in don sit there here know how you don like that one do not the weird one the one that painful so bad happy that they re recording that headphone the headphone that you have to put on backwards with the little little thing and the little little foam block on it painful painful microphone think it th the the crown versus the the that the actual name the manufacturer don see manufacturer on it wait here it is thingy it the the crown of pain re on line you are your mike your mike on you been working with these know what going on have do alright where are we re this don think it can handle french but anyway we have something coming in person is and we get certain have vector and vector and everything is fine an and and our and our you just you just stick the the the the microphone actually in the tea no um not drinking tea are you talking about yeah let just assume our net just three decision for the time being three he to know something about it he to know where it is he to go there of these would be wha how we would answer the question right is what you it like it to me we re we know how to answer the question is but no can can do the node in here too and say yeah but in the let just deal with the the simple case of we re not worrying about timing or anything just want to know how we should answer is um and there two right there and not there assume those are the posterior of that on or and he to know something about it and he to know something he to know it is me these um see why we can do that um in this case we would probably all agree that he to go there belief net he to go there right the whatever if we have something like this here and this like that and maybe here also some should probably make them out of it something like that then we would guess our belief net that he to know where it is than actually to go there it this assume though that they re evenly weighted guess they are evenly weighted the different decision you mean the there the on and the yeah this is making the assumption do you mean by differently weighted don feed into anything really mean why do we we the there node more th much more than we the other then we would conclude even in this situation that he to go there in that sense we weight them equally sense right now the guess the the question that was as er wondering or maybe robert was to me is do we make the decision on as to which one to listen to so the final decision is the combination of these three again it it some kind of net sure so then the question then my question is to you then would be is the only reason we can make all these smaller because we know we can only deal with finite set of we re just taking arbitrary language in we have node for every possible question you know decision node for every possible question you mean like in the case of the ca piece of language we be able to answer it with this system if we just we have the correct node what you re is node right and if we if someone you know something in is to the system we know which node to look at to answer that question right but but if we have finite don see your point what what am thinking or what we re about to propose here is we re always get the whole list of and their posterior now we need an expert system or belief net or something that that that at all the and the winner is go there go there now the winner is on he to know something about it and what it does regardless of of of the input but how does the expert but how does the expert system know how who which one to declare the winner if it know the question it is and how that question should be on the what the question was so what the discourse the ontology the situation and the user model gave us we came up with these for these know how do we weight what we get out as which one are important my if we were to it with net we have to have node for every question that we knew how to deal with that would take all of the and weight them appropriately for that question that make sense nay mean are you saying that what if you try to scale this up to the situation or are we just dealing with arbitrary language that your point no guess my question is the reason that we can make node or see if confused we going to make node for every question that make sense not for every question construction don necessarily would think mean it not based on it based on like there be node for there or not and there be node for someone question do we decide how to answer it look at look yourself with this question get this have is what you get now you have to make decision do we think does this tell us not knowing what was and what and whether the person was tourist or local because all of these have presumably already gone into making these posterior what we need is just mechanism that is just don think winner take all type of thing is the mean in general like we won just have those three right have like many many we have to like that it no longer possible to just look at the themselves and figure out what the person is trying to say there are right the no if if for example the there posterior possibility is so high um if it if it certain height then all of this becomes irrelevant even if if the function or the history or something is scoring pretty good on the true node true value don know about that that would suggest that mean to go there and know something about it they have to be mutual they have to be mutually exclusive think to some extent they are maybe they re not the way you describe what they meant they they seem mutually exclusive to me if he want to go there even if the posterior there is no is and on is yeah just out of the other three though that you had in the those three the seem like they were mutually exclusive no there no through the th so yeah but some some would drop out and some would still be important guess what me is if we have net to deal another net to deal with this stuff you know is the only reason so guess if we have another net to deal with this stuff the only reason we can design it is we know what each question is think that true then so the only reason way we would know what question he is based upon so if say had construction parser and plug this in would know what each construction the communicative intent of the construction was and so then would know how to weight the appropriately in response no matter what they said if could map it onto construction ge could say ah well the the intent here was right and could look at those mean do need to know mean to have that kind of information also agreeing that simple the where we have clear winner about the where it all sort of middle ground those out and just hand over the where we have winner because that would be the easiest way just compose as an output an message that there now historical information not care whether that consistent with anything in this case if we say definitely he want to go there just to know where it is or let call this this to know something about the history of he said me something about the history of that the for some reason the really high score too can expect this to be sort of at point three three three point three three three point three three three needs to that know know needs to be some knowledge that but the net that would merge just that had my hand in between my mouth and my er my and my microphone then the net that would merge there that would make the decision between there on and would have node to tell you which one of those three you and based upon that node then you would look at the other stuff mean it that make sense sort of one of those that more like decision tree if if you want first look at the and then intend to say that every possible was confusion there intend to say every possible thing should go into the net because some of the relevant in the net for specific question the is not necessarily relevant in the net for until after you decided whether you go there or not us the way guess the other thing is that um yeah mean when you re specific question and you don even if you re question you may not even look like ask for the posterior probability of the node right that what mean in the net you always ask for the posterior probability of specific node mean you may not even bother to compute you don need we always all no can compute the posterior probability of one subset of the given some other but totally ignore some other also you ignore get over but that that just shifting the problem you would have to make decision if it question which you have to make decision do query un would think that what you want to do eventually you still have to pick out which you look at it pretty much the same problem it it it it and mean maybe it does make difference in of performance computational time either you always have it compute all the posterior for all the for all and then prune the you think that are irrelevant or you just make estimate of what you think might be relevant and query those basically you have decision tree query there if that false query this one that true query that one just basically do binary search through the don know if it would necessarily be that complicated mean it in the case of there it would be the case if you an there was true you know what was if it was false you look at either lo on or true guess so in way you would have that somewhat by that why that can figure out how to get the into it look at me hopefully it fixable ju yeah yeah just think haven there figured out what the in mean versus what java are by the way are we know whether jerry and nancy are coming we can figure this out should come when they re done their stuff basically whenever that is what do they need to do left guess jerry needs to enter but don know if he do that now or later if he enter it take him awhile guess and he won be here what nancy doing nancy she was finishing up the calculation of and of but don know if she should be here or she should be free after that so assuming she coming to this meeting don know if she about it on the list right she basically what where we also have decided prior to this meeting is that we would have rerun of the three of us sitting together sometime this week again and finish up the of this we have it or not we have all the bottom here added bunch of for we we have what we have is this line what do the do the the the for instance this node got two that one you those are the bottom are also see that was lot more sense to me now thought it was like that one in stuart book about you know the in the dog the earthquake and the alarm two there dog one too but that in java it there something about bowel or something with the dog we have all the top all the to which no are pointing we re missing are the these where are pointing where we re combining top we have to come up with for this and this this this and so forth maybe just fiddle around with it little bit more um then it just many of um we won meet next monday of meet next tuesday guess jerry leaving for on friday friday this friday friday friday as in four days three days he long is he gone for huh what there it country it not conference or anything just visiting visiting pretty nice place in my brief encounter with it you yeah part of what we actually want to do is sort of schedule out what we want to surprise him with when when he comes back so think we should disappoint him or have finished construction parser and working belief net and be disappointing think we should do absolutely no work for the two that he gone that actually what had personally had had sort of out in my mind that you do lot of work and do nothing then sort of yeah that good too sort of bask in in your glory do you have any vacation because myself am going to be um gone but this is actually not really important this weekend we re going be this gone this weekend too ah we re all going to be here on tuesday again like it then meet meet again next tuesday um finish up this net once we have finished it guess we can um and that going to be more just you and me because is doing probabilistic recursive structured object reasoning um reasoning the difference you re saying next tuesday is it the whole group meeting or just us three working on it or or the whole group we present our our final definite when you were saying we need to do re run of like just working out the rest of the should do this th the upcoming days week this week yeah you say the whole group you mean the four of us and keith ami might ami might be here and it possible that nancy be here yeah th you know once we have the belief net done re just have to explain it to me then on tuesday how it all work out know will then once we have it sort of up and running then we can start you know the and then feed stuff into it and get stuff out of it and then hook it up to some fake construction parser and you will have in about nine or so um the first bad version be done in nine can worry about the ontology interface and you can keith can worry about the discourse mean this is pretty mean hope everybody that these are just going to be dummy right where the so so if the if the there is and no then there discourse will just be fifty fifty what do you mean the there no then the there is don get it don understand the there on all those four what are the of the there discourse it on the situation the discourse is strongly that but we have no discourse input see the specifically in our situation and are be whatever so far we have that what the keith node is you re taking it out for now this is this can can get it in here the are can get it in here so th have the um let let call it keith node is an somewhere printed you go have the same problem with my name um th th does the go before the or after the in my name the good you you said people have the same problem thought my goes after the the have the inverse problem with my name always have to check every time send you an past of yours to make sure spelling your name correctly good worry about you appreciate that when you abbreviate yourself as the you don use any it because of the michael who is my hero re geek do you do you pronounce your name eva eva eva if were if were to call you eva probably still respond to it had people call me eva but don know no not just eva eva if take the and pronounce it like it was german is no idea then like an also an in german which is why it just the difference between voiced and unvoiced as long as that mean might slip out and say it accidentally all saying fine matter what those are anyway because we just make the zero for now make them zero for now because it who who what they come up with what come in there um then should we start on thursday not meet tomorrow send an make time suggestion maybe it so that that that we can that we have one node per construction even in people like they don know what you re talking about if you re some sort of strange construction they would still sort of get the best fit yeah but mean the mean that what the construction parser would do mean if you said something completely arbitrary it would find the construction right if you said something that was er theoretically the construction parser would do that if you said something for which there was no construction whatsoever people have any idea what you were talking about dog fried egg mean know if even something chinese for example something in yeah cantonese as the case may be do you think about that mean how many do could we possibly have for this system or in no we when people do this kind of thing when many do people have have not the idea it considered to be like in are they considered to be like very sort of abstract noun is construction so it like in the the any form meaning pair to my understanding is construction form at the level of noun actually maybe even goes upwards until you get the construction then of course the guess maybe there can be the there be of the dit level the giving speech construction mean you know you can probably count count the ways mean would definitely say it finite at least in that all that really as long as your analysis is finite that it can be finite again can think of way it would be infinite you can come up with new the if your if your brain was totally non deterministic then perhaps there way to get an infinite number of that you have to worry about mean in the practical sense it impossible if we have fixed number of the best case scenario would be the number of or the worst case scenario is the number of the number of two to the power of the number of still finite no wait necessarily is it can end the meeting just you use different different of activation across lots of different to specify different yeah but there like certain level of issue right so you can do better than something off the it really tough for the you re popular two three four five six on seven re on probably the think we so think we re it should be really short meeting hope agenda number one talk since we were just that is microphone the heck are we do about got on that the group like the do think find them very comfortable but it to depend on your head shape does do do too you need to start going to the see right don work for me very well much prefer these right too do prefer these but don mind those those are apparently they they like one good effect that people are trying to get there early because the people who get there early get to pick the mike who show up late have to use these um we should probably get different the question is the easiest thing to do is certainly to just get two more um two more of those um that that easy and that will certainly work the other option is to try yet another mike one we like and potentially get six all the same have question about this the auditory quality it much different between this kind and the the fancy these are better if they re worn correctly are those are better than the you definitely you to to them mean they re not lot better but they are little better they more directional the as far as they re more directional little better error noise cancellation and also you can really get it right in front of your mouth like this whereas that one to avoid breath noise you really have to put it at to the side you seem to get better signal with this one the other thing is is it just few people who don like them in the group don know but you know in in sort of random polling liz liz said something that leaves me believing that nobody them are much prefer them think they re whole lot multiple better shame to discard discard them if if they re better auditory quality and there re only few people who dis who object mean so that why was saying if we could just unplug them and plug them in mean that the other option is that we could switch the form so it more obvious the distinction between channel and mike um and then get know pretty mean there no problem with that just what we get just more hate the are those the one you re wearing it it the one wearing those the too much mean so if you wear it sort of around the back it not too bad hate it because it hard to adjust the microphone mean spend all this time fumbling around with it and still not reasonable yeah mean we could try another mike then we have the wiring issue and don know what to do do what do people think the problem is again the the plug or the plug is proprietary that why was saying getting more is trivial because we can just go out and buy them other we have to buy them in pigtail and get them wired now may maybe just don know this but um are the only two from the two that we tried is there another the only from are that one and the lapel mike see see this is the one we re wearing that something so we had these wired for us see it like right now if if what they re are those if we just got two more of these so remember that now think that probably the right first step is just get two more immediately and have them available then they can just unplug those from the just make sure that you write down or on the mike number which change to mike type or something like that transmitter might be good to double check at the end of the meeting too that would be an easy place for an error in the data for it to be forgotten it be me be whoever setting up the meeting who out the key file so it just just thinking that if it be yeah but know but mean to have the user fill it out be as reliable as have the the same potential for error as everything else no no we definitely would not have the user fill it out would be me chuck or liz depending on which meeting it is so we de definitely go ahead and do that much is it just to buy the mike hundred that more or less than you thought on how good the mike is that way more than thought yeah for one of these the were like two fifty think those are like one ninety god there any educational discount right no discount good are expensive when was at we used the ten and think they were only like eighty or something eighty or ninety for the they were they pretty good mean the are expensive because they re proprietary so they can charge whatever they want are expensive because they re quite high quality right we should buzz that out if we send the data to ah come on should keep list of we re out and the under which just you do not have to that out don mind if my opinion we re pro double check with morgan he did say yes before went to japan on another wireless system so that we can go all wireless instead of the mix of wired and wireless think that the right thing to do then all those red there would become wireless huh more wireless also re probably replace the andrea mike with but test it sometime today or tomorrow to make sure the one really works have an extra in my office the andrea mike apparently it had some causing yeah one is the andrea mike was over here sometimes wired one the yeah wired one if you re go to all wireless you mean in the one the right because ah see it it probably take couple to get it from anyway haven the that always been at most six people so never had to really haven had to used any of the wired at all guess everyone been out of town over the summer it be the same it to be less people done with microphone think we close the door you want thinking don know about the acoustics that all was wondering about this way we can get door slam in the in the transcript file that right we get the obligatory door slam well no not quite slam some special phone for that the door slam phone guess right the door slam phone have special phone no we could add one we could add one yeah then we could have the phone phone an idea for for when the phone file reorganization is something we were talking about before left and saying we should probably wait until after back and now back so we should do that at some point we should get ourselves list of everything we do to reorganize the file structure and anything else can just mention something think the file reorganization um another issue there is disk space probably right so know that the that you been cutting up for us for the recognition one way one really brain brain dead way of of of not causing any trouble but saving disk space is to use the the the encode program to to encode you know to compress them that the same as shorten yeah but it does it it so that the program that the does the transparently you mean it built into the because we have the same thing with shorten in the sound guess but it um it just question of of what decompression is built into your it like actually built into the library that so really know that actually the sound don understand that for the least least that not sound tool right since since these are made to be used with the recognizer and the front end the library which in turn does this transparently um that will be quick and quick and easy way to just get you know be able to use more the other thing could do to relieve some of the pressure um is just move everything to my eighteen gig disk which is local that be only temporary mean don know mean you should do that too probably but but as you do that you can also just run the it is kind of temporary solution shorten everything well actually the th what you do is you run now have another use for the the way recently used it and there might be better ways the program encode think the type you say um think dash and then there are different different but if you use the shorten one you say minus shorten and then the old and the new and then then check you know if this works so you can use the the shell operator or something just move the new to the you know to the old and then you have the old one with one that identically as long as your that use it know how to decode it on the fly that that just saved my butt because actually was running different experiment had segmented was the whole two corpus which is two hundred eighty of speech and was as was almost finishing the that was running out of disk space and so had this flash of inspiration of just the same the same disk had the segmented on them so everything on the fly while this other thing was still going on was run was running this this thing had another process running that was shortening it wow low and behold three three gig of space and um you know you have to re nice one of the to make sure that shorten no no it was fast enough is very fast this really quickly that must have been suspenseful the disk meter was very suspenseful was that was the most excitement had all weekend boy it came out just fine be know what would be don know if this would mess other up but like kind of pain to have all these split up around would be easier would be like the list yep know like original start end end is the way does it the the only reason we do this is because the the front end have way to to um go into longer file with indices so suppose segment on the fly someone could try to put hack like that into the would be easy be hard at all just needs to sit down and do it who some time there also some guess that way we have multiple floating around the only difficulty with that is if it compressed you really do have to decompress it first true the are you don know how much it is there is there is there routine which compress it by fixed amount right right right right can seek in compressed file but with uncompressed indices don think so yeah mean that it no no mean if you the the the you can operate on the full you don have to segment it then there would be less of reason to do the compression because you don have that wasted that extra copy we mean the original are not compressed right we could leave those as they are mean it just on how much disk space is problem mean the what you could do is decompress it to temporary place and then operate on it and then delete it mean the segmentation also you space in the sense that you cut out all the yeah if you have you know twenty and only five then it true assuming you that you then off load the original it like just shortening them is good short term solution so we don have to do any yeah think kind of had was big disk crash when you were gone and no it was was still here was the day left was that the day you left suspicious did it on purpose to japan the day the disk no if if had done it on purpose would have timed it right after left um so chuck me out in all the cha the different channel for like few for like six think they re split up even further kind of even more now since we some of the to different re on different disk even right they think you you expand them to on no you the that different the that you put them on when you put them on don remember where put them now think you put them on what we what we found out was that um the disk that was it with with meta disk allocation you had both and the and the expanded were all on were on the same sorry different of the same physical disk disk it conceivable mean don mean so um was told that it possible that that might have additional wear on it it to to go bad sooner think there was something else going on because dave said that was getting frequently it be huh data never touched because we write it once and then we never touch it again why not sure it does after each meeting we copy the data to that mean so the or or anything at all because the are there as well the wave mean he was saying see so it to be the wave there was something weird about that that right so dave about it and he into it yet but we should definitely double check on it like like the same meeting that we pull off of when we re done doing the recording to the backup as if they had been written you know every single night night that right for you know week in row which is really weird very strange realize that at any rate so for file reorganization we need to first decide what we re do and then when we re do it not sure who involved with that mean certainly me chuck and jane else care and like in of the to also you know send bit to dan to see if it if there any get his input on it don think don think that be no maybe we should do that not during this meeting but another time and just get list of everything we re do next week if we could trying to finish up some stuff sure like to just update all the naming and put all the where they really belong on one disk like good idea and then leave leave everything in place until the back up until the next full back up and then delete the old now and you re just you re not talking about the the the just the backed up space or both need to be um various th mean this is why we have to do it in synchronized way because um think we should also at the same time try to convert over to your new naming exactly too be good that what was saying need to get list of all that stuff that we do so really get any from the naming that sent out so assume that alright with everyone actually haven at it yet haven had chance so no haven either will by next week though don know about the naming mean should have made that as an agenda item so these that we been so far are with just change them you know without some advance notice mean th that all these segment that we we been would rather not mess with them until we have some closure on some of the we are currently dealing with so mean how you choose to do it the naming is up to you re talking about different mean it should probably be eventually should probably be consistent with what you re doing but yeah kind of agree with andreas like little bit mean these at the naming and they look fine to me but at the same time it was just like you know to rename everything would be if we we change it won really affect what you re doing will it no but think just to be consistent we should also mean have the same just in case you want you but you can switch that any time you want right mean it only affect my work it not mean if we assume you re not go like into you know my and change my file will use it slash slash star was do global search replace on all at at to change to at all at that be great enjoy that no with no advance warning you maybe say that on re record was typo in some of the that morgan got that someone one of our did global sear search and replace for between sponsor and their name no oh no so it it was saying anyway won one one can imagine that that might be problematic not sure whether that right one can imagine the that that would engender this this name change subset need to reflect everything yeah you had you to talk about the had one one short point have just version on one of our so it available under now great someone just got an this week from someone as that great re to sh have already to him don know what what what he what the problem was was really straightforward really easy this is not sorry just who did you talk to was some some guy from who to to install he sent an that he install it and just him well what did and it was really straightforward so this is not just the this is the right it the so the excellent the that dave you should probably talk to and get it put in some central place that it work on all the mean as it guess yeah see what you mean it be on the on the side but accessible through the drive could do that assume already on the machine so you had to install it had to install it yeah andreas would it be appropriate to ask how the are going well yeah actually sure whether this is the right meeting for it because it very little to do with with meeting but you know did run um some recognition with front end and and you know this is the joint work with chuck and um first you know we had we figured out sometime last week how to um and and chuck wrote this really nice little script script that the feature calculation and then it out into the into um so file which is what the system to read essentially know it like except instead of you have feature following the header um that all done um by the script and it works great first trained up two because it gender you know the system is gender dependent so to be comparable trained um on sh on so short training set um male system and female system and also for and for the heck of it trained um trained on the same training set standard system with the front end from scratch um and the two what did you use we used twelve not just and actually that one of the had was what the would possibly buy us um we talk about that later the so the system the system was used also used twelve mel mel um based on twenty four filter bank um analysis do not know what the the of the um front end is from hertz to th th thirty se thirty seven fifty or something like that seven fifty do not know what the um um front end would do mean what the is but the are such that let see one other slight difference right two two yeah the system also does um vocal tract length normalization and we figure out how to do that yet with the that one difference the other difference is that in the in the system the th the first the zero the energy feature is slightly differently from the rest what they do is they they subtract the maximum for each segment they subtract the maximum of of th over that segment from from the of for that is kind of automatic gain control that is they subtract the from each one or do they subtract each one from the subtract matter no just would be sign change you get lot of the other way right right and then after after they done this based normalization they then do conversation length normalization just like all the other it their kind of two stage normalization now understand that the common practice here been to just do standard mean subtraction um on the for the zero in what we done so far because we have any special provision for zero we just treat it as as any of the other we done standard mean subtraction over the whole conversation side um since both and use this sort of local normalization for zero that presumably you know someone done some to and found out that that works better so that another difference and that might account for some of the in the but you know the the are um should start the there two tried it with and without without and with adaptation many for the adaptation we always do three to and it it this it this quick and dirty the phone loop adaptation which actually require prior recognition and and so this is not the best you can do with adaptation but it you sort of first idea of what you could gain with it then you know so we have the the front end and the front end and other than that the system configuration was identical it was the same came up with um you know same number of per state cluster same the clustering used the same information loss threshold which actually led to roughly the same number of overall that the system configuration is is comparable and the so without adaptation you had forty nine error rate or recognition rate is error rate in percent with adaptation it forty seven point one and this this was fifty two point six and fifty one point three and then when combined them can actually combine them with something like actually more sophisticated than but it here got forty eight point five and here got forty six point five this is just combination at the utterance level the utterance level right do you think the front end is so much worse question fine really odd to me so one percent would attribute to the lack of about one percent right right right ah then maybe another up don know how much the zero normalization business really can it see mean can see it the can you run the as an experiment run the front end without vocal tract norma normalization and see how much difference it could could certainly do that could also do the vocal tract length normalization with the something we to do yeah could was actually thinking we could use the warping that we compute for the we could figure out how and just try them with the front end we already have the capability to apply the warping to the um to the dan added the dan added that in but but the won they don correspond one to one though no but they should be close since this mean the can certainly try the front end without sh that that certainly quick to do and so and and then there all these um know the number of um know this front end had fair amount of experimentation going into it know how many filter do you use what what do you use and stuff like that we could play the same kind of with the front end actually the analysis very crucial role used to use narrow and that hurt us this is um this is now used roughly what everybody else is um there some room for figure in this in the front end the good news is that even with this with the system being that much worse you still get win out of combining the two that some hope for the future however this to be reduced with adaptation so interestingly the the difference actually would actually expect it or or hope that the adaptation the difference because it might um for instance um remove some of the um know you if you have some some difference in the front end that is suboptimal but can be possibly by you know moving the um moving the around but apparently that really actually the difference becomes so right now what doing is um well there several going on is that chuck is working on getting the tandem um into form that we can train the tandem the system on the tandem that would actually be the more interesting experiment the other thing is training the on the large training set that we usually use to build our evaluation and then we can actually want to do the system combination um with our system um on some subset of the data at least probably only for the because don have time to train both and but um and um about ta the two feature into single one pretty big does get pretty big my experience with that in was usually combining at other works better for for whatever that worth you tried that on yeah different feature you try was mostly see you know the feature we had available it was almost always better to combine at the probability level know so we run the neural and combine the see and it does become sort of unwieldy to have these very large feature that would blow up the also have to do some sort of normalization afterwards so that they re orthogonal you do linear transform also so the and then we could start little bit to try to get the front end to perform better and as preliminary just sort of diagnostic experiment we can can certainly run system without just to get without what tract thing yeah that that quick to do was thinking about tandem system let not talk about it here but had some about the tandem system yeah so but are moving ahead so should we do we have any other let do them one at time instead of simultaneous since we actually have time reading of no one five nine four two three two seven seven zero nine nine nine seven nine three eight zero one two nine eight five

prosody where it goes meeting actually have one more thing that don know if it if if it to to bring up after the dis don know it might be important for um liz that she had meeting where ahead it was later found that several of the were turned off um and this must become problem especially with non speech um is there way that the could warn you if it from some of the or could probably build that in to the front end it you know it really annoying if you go through all that trouble and then basically the because even are people doing they re switching their off or something don know what they do the went dead or th they just they with the thing and it leave it in the on position or whatever don know eh would you like it to do when that no if if you um mean obviously you always mean there never be signal from all the right because or rarely if an unblacked out channel is zero is actually spitting out you can be pretty sure it off it spit out it out there little background noise the question is when the it what do you want it to do good question don know is there some can collectively think of some of some mechanism that might reduce the risk of of just mean it it it we already have visual feedback right can see whether your mike is working or not maybe it just to admonish people to actually look at the screen at the beginning of the meeting to make sure they get signal off the screen saver during the meeting them to test their or something think they sh don know what to do other than it can if one of the while recording no sound out right now mind should give the electric shock to the person recording the meeting yeah would be good we can think about what to do about it but it yeah good one that not bad idea pretty clear we can detect it so we done would say between the of to old it was really big thing to go to the movie on saturday mornings one particular movie theater we went to they would show every saturday which were continued story if you one saturday you would miss what in particular episode and you um know what had taken place we would go every saturday morning also at this theater they gave to different people one of the way they gave was they would take big group and everybody and there were going up to balcony real wide the big group of people would go stand on the and there would be probably or in the picture they take the picture and then you would go back the next saturday after they had been and they would have circled or people in the picture and the people whose head was circled would get the that for real for real really one time can remember think it was steve my brother um he and they would give like candy don even remember what all of the would give for some reason and think this is really true he got ice cream of ice cream of course there nothing to do with of ice cream when you re at hour movie re going to melt another um that was in that was in then we to charlotte and we used to go to and don think its even still there don know if the building is or not but the lived in the area and we would go to the and do remember that it cost to get ticket to get in we would could go to the movie would get maybe each to go to the movie and sound like old with those of but we would go to the movie and then you would go in and get your your snack that you there were several different don ever remember getting popcorn at the movie until was or in my adult life we would buy is what they call them now but we them and we would get often cent sucker you making fun no love this story the cent is what is to now as pop we them cent because every other sucker cost penny these were because they had the in the middle there was one other sucker that cost nickel and we that an all day sucker just because you eat the whole thing for the entire movie and you would really just have that sucker all day long one other form of refreshment that we got which really embarrassed my mother because she know anything about this until she went with us to the movie one saturday there was bakery next door to the movie my and myself were not the only people that did this all the that would go to the movie knew to do this would go into the bakery and we would ask for nickel worth of we even have to ask for it because the bakery lady knew us and she knew to have all this ready for all the going to the movie what it was it was broken and broken of whatever while they were baking they would fill little for us and we would give them nickel and we could take that to the movie with us that all the can remember about the right now do know that did used to go the movie downtown at the carolina when was young it strange thing for the to just go off and go to movie mean my mother knew where we were going and she knew when we would get back but today you send your seven or eight year old child to movie alone even if they were with their nine year old brother you just do it we could skate to the movie or ride bicycle to the movie and we would do that is kind of sad that you can do that and it not just because are there re bad people in the world but it too much traffic have to check everything about movie check it out to see what the content is and just like that when was growing up about that same time period in my life guess again between seven and ten old which to be what remember most vividly my best friend was kathy and she was next door neighbor also and we up until she was about and she away with cancer we we close fact we an apartment first apartment either one of us ever had when we were um little we used to play did we used to try to dress up and pretend we were we would go to work and pretend we had an apartment together and then when we grew up we sure did we got an apartment huh kathy and also used to play other kind of dress and it just it like remember we both had like our mother long or the would be long on us and we would literally wear dress up clothes that to our we had kathy had one pair of or of some sort of necklace that was her mother and have the necklace it was really beautiful and really really one we only had the one necklace and we er we decided don know if it was jointly or if kathy was just extremely nice of whatever but she said could wear it part of the time we would literally time the amount of time we wore it like or or whatever the way we decided who got to wear it first and this always kind of me because know kathy did this intentionally she said the one got to wear it first and she was like six younger than am it that normal thing with us we only had one of something she would always say think the one to do it or wear it or whatever first that just always stuck in my mind that in in our adult life brought that up to her and she sort of like she know anything about that and thought to myself she does and then she about it and she that she had trump card on that one also we did lot of and as said we career and the dress my sister and used to pretend also and jill is about younger than am maybe two and half and we used to play robin except we have marion we had don know where in the world that name came from we would switch robin one would play robin and one would play was the counter would be the same thing as marion and why again don know why we use marion in my mind can remember that like all day long we would go over to my and they had big white house with big front porch and on it and lot of rocking out on the front porch it was just great place to pretend and we would climb up on the porch and on the and we could make those our or it could be castle just do many with it and when we were still living in in our back yard we had huge don know guess it was an oak tree but it was really big tree but it was climbable tree it had real large thick extending out to the side and they were fat enough where as child of eight and nine old we could straddle the that was another game that jill and used to play we would pretend we were in the jungle and we would climb up on the tree and we would straddle the tree and pretend it was our elephant in the yard we had an old tree that had been cut down and just the stump was and my mother had um all around that stump and we would use that stump as as throne and the princess got to sit up on that stump on that throne and have all those around her and that would be the throne and she would be the queen or the princess or whatever was an audrey movie came out think was probably or old we were of driving age had group of that ran around with and there were golly there might been to of us who were good had their own best friend but then we had one big group that we used to do lot of together and we would had that many but we would only go out in couple of and remember one of the betty her dad had and we fit like in that betty turn no huh no we went out one night to the movie but before we went to the movie we went to get pizza and then we went to and think the name of the place was the and we have chain pizza like we do now like and all that was just really neat pizza place that all the would go we went to and we would have eight or and we would order one pizza and all share it and everyone would only get one piece and think we would make the mad because we have money to leave would also drink water it good situation for the but we had fun and we even think about it just did what we could get away with that night we were go see and think it was on at the and just remember when you have like or so going somewhere to the same place it kind of pretty much of spectacle we re all in this long line and we re giggling and laughing and cutting up and really great time we bought our and we went into the and we found row of and we sat file all in just remember seeing and was sitting in middle section was not on an end so had knew on both sides of me just remember that movie was had lot of about being really scary and suspenseful and it nothing like these that are out today like and what is it on whatever it is where they re actual horror was real intense um drama and just very scary kept you on the edge of your seat there was scene in the movie remember where every one of us and it just our group but so many people in the they out at one time that really all remember about that night it was just lot of fun really hope that my have had some nights like that and had good times like that that can remember going out with good back to our show is maria and don know your last name that good maria where did you grow up you born in this area here was born in outside of in stanley you were little did your read you or did somebody read you in your house read to me and my sister huh kind of were your you remember any that were maybe real favorite of yours kind of them all really have favorite no particular like with or you think of story that they told you that you for them to read over and over think my favorite was like red that book red when you read to yourself did you read different than the they would read to you basically something different you get to go to the library when you were little huh all the time you would check out huh to spend time reading really when was little like to read your family do you remember if there was any storyteller my uncle was always telling and we had this house across the street from where grew up that was old and he ever finished it it and he told that um um men being in it that house at night and stuff and for us not to go outside at night he scare you we at certain time we were to go over there because we always go outside and look at the house across the street did he tell to big of people or just one on one to our and all of us that hung around each other all the time huh do you have at your house no only on sunday my niece and nephew and my huh you like to read to them they bring their over read to my niece the pop out huh old is she ah six the that pop out at you for me to read them to her she read to herself yet yet but she to she just at the she what grade is she in you know in kindergarten in kindergarten pretty much all need to know about how you reading and when you were little there anything else you like to say about this that comes to your mind no not so much my name is sandra reid and am part of family of seven um and my and dad have away our young we were very poor did not have very much but my always found way to keep us busy or keep us and one of the ways that she kept us was by telling reading and singing to us of the that would like to share with you is the story that is pretty scary and it sticks out into my mind guess mostly mainly because it was scary though my told us lot of scary she was always there to hold us in her arms and let us know that the story was not true and that it was we were of all of my and was the one of all as far as working around the house of my learned to cook by the age of eight learned after got married so was pretty lazy child when it came down to cleaning up and cooking one night my mother me to go inside and wash the start crying and one of my main ways of getting out of work was always saying something hurt me either my stomach or that had headache or something was wrong with my leg anything to get out of doing my job after she that was going to be just little stubborn and not follow do what she tell told me to do she me to come around in the living room with her and the rest of the family she to tell this story upon time there was this little girl and her family the mother the little girl to please go in and wash the so that she could go to bed early and not come up wake up in the morning and see all those on the table her little girl just don want to wash the don want to leg my head don feel good the little girl disappointed her mother so badly but her mother said in the world am ever going to get her to wash these she said girl little girl if you don go in there and wash those like you something really really bad is going to happen to you the little girl just said go in there and wash the she was in there and crying and mad and taking all her good time of sudden the butcher knife came out of the drawer and it to roll around in the air before you know it the butcher knife came around and cut the little girl head off when the little girl went to heaven she was crying down to her dad and saying cut my head off with the butcher knife that knife when went to sleep it really me the wonderful thing about it my was always there close by to let me know that was after that my mother continued to tell us many many scary and tell us many many many like to tell you about how got into becoming teacher assistant my life always to be teacher even from the time to school was my dream to teach school as told you in the past we were very poor family and never got the chance to go to college because of this while was in high school teacher of mine that had an extra bone in my foot and she said now sandra we can use this as get toward on your grant to go to college she said home and talk to your mother about it and see if we you know can follow through with for grant scholarship grant for you that night went home and my mother about it and she said really want you to go to college always been my dream that my all go to school because there are so many in the family there are other you re going to have to have to go to school and just don have the money that time my dad was in prison at the time so it made it really hard for my sat there and cried but tried to be as understanding as possible because knew my mother really hard to even keep food on the table for us never got chance to go to school anybody my brother went to school went to and then to transferred to so to make it easier on my to as far as you know him at home and going to school too he graduated from um here in charlotte had another sister who went to where she got business degree there in later went on to college some but complete the whole four remember once when was working in mill and was spinning yarn and was saying to myself and was praying actually and said god one day want to work in the school system could just work even as teacher assistant would be happy as the went by my prayer was and got the chance to work in the cafeteria as cashier and the principal there came up to me and said you considered being teacher assistant said would love to they told me about some classes that could take at never gone to college before was really afraid he told me to go ahead and try it so took the entrance test and they accepted me into at the school and took some there while the principal said would like for you to bring me your um transcript so can see what your are like had all did very well he me to be teacher assistant the next following year my dream my were enjoy my job very much can think of any job that would make me any happier few later um had the opportunity to apply for scholarship to further my education first want to apply for it but the principal me during the summer and said sandra the time is running out you need to apply he told me would have to write this paper like writing at the time but took it upon myself to go ahead and write paper went to um one of my staff and her if she would proofread it and she thought it was an excellent paper went ahead and mailed it in thinking won get the scholarship don just so can work in the school be happy one day came in and at my mail and was accepted believe it of who had applied for this grant only got the opportunity so felt very of myself went on and took the and as think was taking economics think that was the last class took husband very ill with cancer and had to make decision as to whether would continue my education or take care of him and felt like to take care of him because he stood by me so much while was going to school you would have been able to be teacher if you had continued and at the time was also working in the classroom guess you say as sub because the teacher that was working with at that time was pregnant and she had to take leave of absence they hired sub but the sub do that much had to take over the classroom worked maybe like four in the classroom and that highly put damper on my wanting to be teacher from all the responsibility along with the fact that was taking care of very sick husband all of this was after decided not to continue never the fact of going back to school just got to certain age and said no can do this so never went back love what do and get chance to teach in classroom go for it so many different did you teach at only worked at two two the first school worked at was and then it was closed down was in those where first come first transfer last come first to transfer out had to was job at or and chose particularly want to come here and when came here everybody that was really really sad because being at then after awhile fell in love with not mistaken think been at for think been here at so and hope never have to leave until retire why did the other school close down the you know really don know that really don know why they closed that school down because it was really nice school and everything but they eventually tore it down because was there think the first year went there was the year they built really nice gym and don think they used that gym no more than three really don don remember why that school was ever closed but it was enjoy what do it right thank you you name is bonnie and was born in san antonio and the story going to tell is about my mother little background first let see her mother family were wealthy people at one time car and extensive land don know if they were or not but know they were land um many and um her grandmother was raised in wealth then the came and apparently everyone lost all their money she was raised in and she married man this is my grandmother talking about they were very poor by this point and they had think seven one particular christmas were very very difficult was no money to buy any at all um for the and my grandfather who was when my mother was this was of course way before that um he must have been very positive person because what he did with the situation was he he told the that there were no this christmas because they had given them all to santa to take the poor and this made the feel happy and of themselves and it gave them good feeling that they had done something very nice for someone less fortunate than themselves felt like that was way to face that situation with such hope and with joy and with love although never met my grandfather have never forgotten that story and when hear of him think what wonderful wonderful person he must have been how long have you lived in charlotte have lived in charlotte um for year lived in charlotte for five came here in we lived here for five then we to for seven and now we been back one year good how do you feel about gun control on the scale they gave one to ten say probably four not totally not one of these people that that we should not be able to buy but don think we should be carrying either you know what mean yeah know mean don think machine automatic don believe in like that but think some people do know that everyone should have the right to have hand gun in their house if they so choose and but think there should be some when you buy one you know they should do more background search on you they should think it should be harder to buy one right yeah there lot of out there that can just go in and buy gun because they don really ask lot of when you walk into those yeah no they don they don ask anything except how old you are don think that kind of scary from california my the last time was like gun my my was getting rifle for my brother that he like an antique one and huh they he had to fill out some but guess california might be don know yeah they might be or you know how we are here in texas it like everybody so not much of but yeah it never even bought gun myself my dad given it to me or someone given me one so probably real illegal you know carrying that even mine yeah it it hard decision to make it really is the only problem have with gun control is that they the ban all of and then the only people carrying are be be the people who are kill you anyway like the bumper sticker it true yeah yeah exactly right it really is because they re get them one way or another they will always have way look at they always have way to get that so right right right and they re illegal so don think it would do us any good to outlaw them all together no yeah agree that it would be like people in people that are are the that are get them and then you have no defense against these people when they do come into your house or something right that true think they ought to teach people how to shoot them too how to take care of one how to act around one when they buy them yeah have have gun gun have have gun management right yeah exactly you cannot take the gun home until you taken this course sign up here something like that yeah or for every college student oh right exactly before graduation god gun control it it such topic in the the and people get so emotional about it yep oh yeah they do they get real emotional about it all the worked with lot of people that hunt and they just they they don see any sense in it at all they think it ridiculous to have any kind of gun control but then of course they re they know what they re doing they don realize there re bunch of crazy people out there that some of them are crazy too whew yeah yeah they go out there and get drunk and start shooting don use it for that well yeah that true they shoot each other thinking they re deer yeah darn thought you were deer bob sorry my mistake yeah don know what to your husband he just never came back like don know yep that lot too yeah oh but guess that it that my opinion on it so what now not sure think we just up yeah thanks bye let see yeah yeah we just say good bye and up thanks bye bye have you ever got one of those that either by computer or somebody going down list and they re either offering service or they re some new product in the area and normally when they call you re either in the shower or you in the middle of cooking something and you had to stop everything to run to the phone yes yes that is that one that you were talking about that was the big one talking about work weird and invariably just about the time going to sleep the phone off the wall huh huh and you re trying to crawl out of half unconscious sleep and answer the phone you either hear the click as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on um hum or you hear somebody already starting reading reading off list of stuff that they read probably thousand times that day already that true or the that are are by computer it just computer voice that comes on the line those are the that really really hate too even had some of them the they re voice and you got to say hello twice before they do anything huh huh yeah sometimes get them on my machine at home so and hate that when got whole bunch of and go through them and most of them from anybody at all what would love to see done to stop all of this huh we got thing in this country you can have your phone number unlisted um hum think law should be to where any of these people think it great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything but if they re going to offer these or these message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of computer to go through and just go down every sequence of for this certain area code and call them um hum yeah see have an unlisted telephone number but still get all of those and then some of them are speaking in foreign language that don even understand so yeah do really feel that that an invasion of my privacy agree with you on that particular subject there let me see that about that as far as any other everyday put stop to some of them as far as the door to door either religious or people um hum peddling if their would either gone to the store to bought it or would for their salesman salesman to come out um hum um hum yeah that true living in an apartment complex though you know you can um you can really stop those people from coming around even though they put up out front that no but they still come up to the front door and you know walk around so usually what do is call the apartment manager and tell him hey there people coming around you know and they re trying to sell something or or they re from religious organization and really hate that really really do had somebody come to the door about two ago and um gosh it was about nine clock at night too it even what would consider you know family hour it time to you know start going to bed and and it was somebody from um oh what was it the jesus christ of and read lot about that particular sect and don particularly care for it so especially don like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me now agree with their right to um pursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to but think they also should respect the sanctity of the american home whether it be in house or in an apartment um hum on my turf if want them there call for them otherwise don want to know they exist right yeah yeah no agree with you there though mean they want to choose that particular religion then that fine with me too you know as long as they don try and pull me in and drag me in and and don like the way that they do it either and and it their mission as they do as they go door to door and they go out into the public and they actually have the serving two like you would say like in an army and two in going around and doing missionary type work and don know just um just don particularly care for that at all and that that one thing that feel really strongly about though is you know people coming up to my door especially religious and wanting to you know to try and get me to join or you know become interested in their religion because have my own now the part about where you said the apartment complex up that no soliciting even gone so far as to put that got storm door on the front of the house and put in don know how much clearer it can be it red sign with silver saying no soliciting should have guess should make another one that religious or otherwise because still get yeah yeah that true yeah no don don have go that far but yeah probably could do the same thing you know don have storm door but sure could rig up something but you know don think that that would stop people mean it like they they see that word and it go instead of stop oh goodness wonder if there be some way we could get these people that do this get their their and their phone and then reverse it and do well that would be technically illegal it be harassment oh gosh but consider invasion of my privacy yeah yeah harassment in itself yeah yeah yeah that true that true well what else believe we pretty much summed everything up know but remember you you about something you off and you said well let me think you about the telephone people coming and soliciting selling at the door you said something else and can remember what it was and thought yeah that that kind of touched nerve right there but we got we got to talking about the um people coming to you at the front door drawing the blank oh goodness is our five up pretty close to it well talking with you pretty close well it was nice talking to you too jim and take it easy now good night thanks bye all right amy how are you doing today fine fine oh all righty think we know what we re going to speak about um tell you what start off how that yeah you go ahead um personally think to set mark with the judicial system and we re talking about criminal that they should bring back um hum on in public in public there is one state that does that by the way yeah really what is that want to say oklahoma saw report something the other night about it they don do them real often which is obviously the death penalty yeah yeah um but think if we quit building these with the color and sixty sixty thousand year to keep an inmate in there on on on life sentence we should start hanging them and get it over with and let just screwing up the system yeah well the are so unbelievable just saw on the news last night that they said the average time murderer you know is in jail is two before he and is like six and burglar is like two that pathetic that pathetic it because they just say there either no room in the system you know in the for them or you know it just that it like the automatic if if judge leeway on what he going to you know sentence someone for between you know two and fifty and you know what his whim to decide it should be two this is true and and and and and the way the law if they sentence you to you know it crazy life in prison then he available for parole if it if it life and day then he not eligible for parole so what you know let quit with the system yeah well even if it life like you say we end up spending sixty thousand year to keep some you know joker in there for life we could spend that money you know for that are or twelve million other would be more useful than that exactly so to me if somebody life you know beyond reasonable doubt they should that should be it you know particularly for some of these really life for life mean there are so many just major major serial and it not just like one instance or something it just some of the that go on the old charles case mean the guy is really yeah and the yeah there just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that um just be to to even even live about the issue about by the judge yeah um hum the the judge presently an opportunity to intervene when there my understanding when there verdict and it for example there hung jury here in two day in eight to four and bam bam the guy got off he was he he was veterinarian and two father and son right yeah about that on the news yeah um kind of back to the second request we been to look at is most criminal an verdict the situation like that say no let just go like regular vote eight to four me that there were eight there percentage certain percentage of the people there with sixty percent of the people seventy percent of the people said hey right rather than have to retrial the whole whole thing and spend all the money for people to you know go back to court and all the and mean it just up costing the fortune you know fortune to keep doing that the guy guilty exactly and the you know the family of these people that have been they just have to have it dragged on for and before they ever get any resolution exactly because it not next day they have the start the trial which is number of and just the situation that much more right yeah yeah think that that if it if it not split decision go with the highest number and let just get on with the program yeah yeah but as far as the by the judge would have to vote against that since there jury because that what the are for is to make the decision um what are your yeah yeah well if saw on one of the talk this woman judge believe from florida and she just just really stiff and saw that in in the of judge that really was conscientious and really you know took the to give sentence for what was deserved it could you could have judge that would really make good impact but likewise you could have the flip side and have some judge that was off or you know had good good old boy network or for whatever you know politics just let all of people through so he he would have heck or she would have heck of lot of power you know if used wrongly so at least the jury system does something to prevent that you know or help it with it anyway don know if it it but like the jury system does have it but also also on that sometimes they go through like three hundred before they hand pick these that they think are going to be the that are going to be the most lenient you know and don know how much they re getting just jury of their at that point they re really getting select group it not just random people it almost should be the first twelve people that they you know that have on list are the that are on the jury and that it yeah yeah get back to price comment when he was found guilty he said well he have any you know from his neck of the well give me break you know you know he have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like he got his or something yeah exactly yeah yeah mean you re you re in so everybody can believe they can like in murder they look for who don know anything about the system well or know anything about the the occurrence you have to be pretty dense yeah you be in have to be in cave not to know what going on or moving it to or somewhere possibly is not the answer yeah oh they have to move it to for people not to know about it practically this is true so true well this been an interesting conversation yeah yeah well really this is up my afternoon from and mean what can say no at home with two little my husband works for oh so you re at the house you re not at the plant oh hold it oh that good that good thought holler there in the background but sure so yeah oh yeah got the dog and two waiting here am locked up in the laundry room thanks lot bye bye oh goodness well let you get it bye ellen what kind of car do you think you re going to buy well as matter of fact was thinking about that the other day and really don know the answer um would sort of like to think about something in the way of sort of sporty car but not any not you know luxury type sporty one but um yeah something that still lots of and you know and oh you do want lot of that stuff yeah well yeah like like some of those they come in really handy what kind of are you going to consider you know what you said something about the about the well what do you call them you said that they have but what about um their reputation of the company or the price um well of course guess price is always the big consideration but it is for me other people don seem to have the same problem yeah well that that big one in my book but um yeah have for for some um over um and would sort of like to buy american yeah but you know not so totally hung up on that that buy something else how about you well um the last car we bought was american because of because of that reason but have not been entirely happy with um several about the car it seem like the quality is quite as high as it to be oh really because several minor sort of but still they cost us money um that we feel like we should have had to pay on car that that was that new um hum you know we bought the car new and after um well well well under two we had to replace the clutch oh and they just said well you know are disposable and said since when brake are disposable you know we know that but never thought clutch was disposable yeah yeah yeah have thought so either yeah so that was that was kind of shock oh oh yeah guess there lot to to think about when you re trying to make that decision yeah you know the less actually the less you spend on car it like luxury they re luxury even though they re much more expensive like like um mercedes they don have the history of breaking down or like that that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable right you would never think of to replace the clutch in mercedes no but then um especially not after two no but on the other hand guess too whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it fortune really oh don know yeah worked with couple of people who have various mercedes and um hum even though they do lot of the work themselves then just the and everything is is pretty expensive but for them it it sort of hobby too to own them yeah what kind of what brand of car are you thinking about or like what are you looking at well haven really really gotten that far with it um always sort of little bit better than some of the but um hum oh guess really don know how come been kind of um guess the are getting to me the and know that lot of people known that have had have been just extremely happy with them that hardly had any at all yeah yeah that think that think they have really good um quality um hum my daughter two different and you know we had some work done on them but it not too bad and the reason one of the we um bought the first one was because friend of ours had that he just really drove for and and and he lived way out in the country so he put lot of on it um hum and you knew it had had been through whole lot um hum and yet you know it it up pretty doggone good so yeah thought they would they seem to be really durable yeah so don know not ready to buy new car yet but don know if if the next time going to try to to stay with something american or if going to go for little more what would consider to be long term investment yeah well and guess you know you always have to think about like your gas mileage and stuff like that you know you oh it easy to get gas mileage in this car it excellent gas mileage yeah yeah that one of the big throwing for some of the foreign um hum well we long enough think so well it bye bye all righty thanks bye bye here goes sharon well what do you think about being the first baseball player to earn million that the only thing found out tonight oh you found that out tonight even that that great think he every penny of it yeah yeah but there are some out there that don believe deserve the money they re getting well it funny how baseball getting less than like

been grading all damn day and am as tired as of hearing other about the finished of pretty much every other academic thought that it might be best to avoid jealously out and scribble of post when looking through my it to me that my output this year me much more sharply than in past do mean the consider foundational to my current professional identity all seem to have been composed in the likelihood that suffering from the equivalent of is awfully high but honestly thought written some of the from early in or so may also be that remember the scene of their writing which would have been in the old apartment the place barely remember ever lived in you have absolutely nothing better to do on friday night feel free to scan through my and tell me what you think should be included in the of post you do have something better to do though by all do it at is someone so young not fun with on friday night grading is important but no fun for boring life should know since when was your age had fun with my adorable son and for another baby need to try to have life outside your computer saying it have more life now then you have and we know how little get out by saturday may at the one that really stuck in my mind was explaining in the of read short while before and its narrative complexity but not being used to reading registered all the technical that the artist was to achieve this the post not only taught me something about the grammar of such but more importantly led to me that there is grammar to look for in the first place thanks lot for that one by saturday may at going through your back and pattern in my so think it would be easier for me because rubbish with to just say all the scene analysis and the close reading like the one and many after that as of also the takedown of and the whole wrote was excellent and the cruel death post you know what talking about right the in and real nazi as relevant today as ever by saturday may at with the previous two don remember if you made here before about turning these into book but if you do you got at least one reader by martin sunday may at to your post that in my reader yesterday by sunday may at it be possible to arrange your into three and give your many the opportunity to vote for one of them by secret ballot feel your british would appreciate that by adam sunday may at wednesday may the occasionally me of how different life is because of it noted on that from statistical perspective what baseball such an amazing sport is that you can watch it your entire life and still see on daily basis something youve never seen before truism know but it the benefit of actually being true this case the something in question was watching the wonderfully hit an inside the park home run and initiate triple play in the same game john with some humbug about it not being an inside the park grand slam which made me remember that had seen an inside the park grand slam at some time in the remote past remember being six or seven old and watching the play the in an afternoon game at and thanks to the miracle of the can definitively say that at approximately on june watched terry hit an inside the park grand slam off joe in game the would go on to win handily the fact that can verify vague of that twenty five ago me in way sometimes forget the is capable of doing realization is obviously not of world historical importance merely reminder that this thing whose existence we take for daily fundamentally weird complement to human memory the fact that at some point in the future can know who rode in an elevator with on december is less weird because chose to write about riding in an elevator with can access detailed information about have no right in detail is another matter entirely joe completely forgotten about him sometimes wish could forget that is the coach came to that was watching dale get tagged out at the plate on what would have been an inside the park slam by chuck wednesday may at for the before he came to the stayed for then he for the red against the in remember him being ineffective and as it turns out he was that remember him which before remember him as being the pitcher who for the team the faced to get to the and the one they faced in it remember that remember that but now that do do as gertrude stein would say is funny by wednesday may at the drug use sexual excess and weird haven your brain yet really bothersome though is when you only remember from your distant past grandpa was alert till the end but when last saw him at age everything he to talk about was in the past by john wednesday may at guess but perhaps your grandfather life at was more interesting than the by wednesday may at know what this post great no stinking cricket by wednesday may at remember from the when the were in the old because it made sense to have team from most of their division pitcher for while burned out toward the end he is player representative now by chuck thursday may at memory by thursday may at like to read about watching baseball more than like to watch baseball by factor of nine given up on watching the actual sport mention of baseball now only sparks of the old and the and the old time baseball is true that at the end of time the old time baseball will be as the very best as they had access to an event that was susceptible to beautiful writing but horrendous to watch in person they smoked prodigious quantity of bene overdue library book is crime against by friday may at the anti the for bill and everything on it is in the so you may use it freely even without attribution september have now gone by since the september in and terrorism is far greater threat to us now than it was then the number and severity of terrorist dramatically as the number of active terrorism was confined to small number of extremist loosely linked by radical islam and hatred of israel and its sole supporter the many more moderate have become world wide willing to kill innocent in order to achieve their the serious have expanded to include in russia india the philippines and elsewhere as well as israel and its sole supporter the the not successful major attack since but this does not mean that we are the could strike any time they choose through any of the numerous so well in our media they have chosen not to attack perhaps because they are waiting to produce an effect even greater than the so they do not appear to be losing strength could be more spectacular than the massive chemical attack think this is what they are waiting for of our frantic may have had some effect in small time casual but they cannot stop serious attack any more than mere door lock can stop serious robber who really to get into your house the administration can keep that we are now under their this claim is merely feel good propaganda intended to keep the neo in power cannot withstand clear headed scrutiny the fact is have completely even to diminish terrorism much less defeat it trying to stamp out terrorism by killing and israel have made infinitely worse for us more dangerous not proof that may come at any moment explosively with one big successful attack here in the may god help us all is the systematic use of violence to create general climate of fear in population and thereby to bring about particular political objective search query terrorism believe that any terrorist act is crime against humanity and against the will of god because it deliberately to injure and kill innocent people purpose here is to by removing the motivation for it motivation terrorism will quickly die down like plant without water completely reject the idea that terrorism can be by brute force because brute force the and they then join the you end up fighting the entire population force in and it is failing in iraq try to be even handed in opposing all terrorism although we recognize that the terrorist threat in the world today comes from radical who falsely believe that allah of their criminal behavior against israel the russia india the philippines australia and whom they falsely believe to be war against allah the second terrorist threat comes from several mainly israel who sometimes resort to terrorism themselves self defense as they desperately try to prevent further by radical all of these above if the radical would cease their all terrorism on both sides of every dispute would quickly end these two there is virtually no terrorist activity in the world with the possible exception of such as in and occasional domestic in various isolated disaffected the moral and religious which support terrorism are quite faulty and erroneous need to be and the terrorist faith in the righteousness of his he is less likely to perform them allah allah islam an every case of terrorism we will find some kind of legitimate underlying grievance we eliminate the legitimate we have much of the motivation this with or trying to appease the as some israeli would try to say no is simply the of human motivation right or wrong deny reality as the israeli do is to invite disaster as they have done big picture of our entire anti strategy can be found at our to you may god help us all to you may god help us all bill and the monday of my life recently returned to the from australia the hour flight took me from monday morning in to monday morning again in the date line up my sense of time enough without the added bonus of thinking should be heading to bed just as the sun to climb into the california sky may be familiar with the concept lag the catch all name for misalignment the disruption of sleep and you had the pleasure of crossing time in jet plane whether it was mere three hour hop from one coast of the to the other or trip to another continent are you experienced some amount of jet lag the of jet lag two the homeostatic system and the system work together to produce hour sleep cycle the day the homeostatic system slowly sleep drive desire to sleep that as function of time spent awake the system an signal in opposition to this sleep drive which during the day person from feeling increasingly sleepy hour or two before bedtime this signal and he it time to hit the pillow the sleep drive as person and by morning assuming full night rest and possibly some coffee he will be feeling alert and ready to go again robert wrote delightful paper on jet lag by the way which is where getting much of my information we got nice cycle of sleep lag is what when the homeostatic and are for example the system may signal person to be alert when it not actually morning or may be reduced during daytime causing daytime sleepiness because the homeostatic sleep drive is no longer out don want to be sleepy do you beat jet lag robert three primary the body clock sleep to counteract daytime sleepiness or insomnia start with the first one as it turns out to be the most complicated the body clock the two most effective ways to reset the body clock are through bright light exposure and timed administration is one of the most important about time of day and the effect on timing much smaller effects are seen from regular and for example have shown that without light totally blind people tend to have free running with an average period of instead of the usual person is exposed to bright light early in the day the person internal clock is reset to an time if exposure is instead in the evening the internal clock is reset to later time light more of an effect such as the sun at to lux though lower lux can produce light can be used to supplement daylight to help reset person internal clock to the correct new time zone when traveling person could wear very dark glasses as light avoidance could help minimize the of light exposure at the wrong time of day or night the body clock part is hormone that been linked to the regulation of and sleep is by the pineal gland at night secretion is suppressed by light exposure and as such the hormone can be thought of as darkness signal of are in the morning will be later evening shift of the is more important than amount per dose though it remains to be seen what the optimal dose and optimal time of administration is have been done with from to at times ranging from three days before departure to five days after arrival in the new time zone of are combined with light exposure the are what you might expect synergistic if both are to produce time shift in the same direction both or both later antagonistic otherwise wake sleep wake the second way to beat jet lag at weird times adjust your sleep schedule to match that of your destination or keep your home sleep schedule for while after you arrive the problem with this is that your sleep wake schedule won match up with that of the people around you and if you need to be awake for breakfast at or for meeting in the afternoon your sleep schedule may interfere this method at your own risk for everything we have sleep as you might guess hypnotic combat insomnia and fight off daytime sleepiness pretty well because by definition that what they do and non have been shown to be effective in the first case for the latter the most common solution is to consume more coffee works the study linked were with slow release caffeine or with prior to long eastward flight the caffeine were less sleepy than either or placebo caffeine also took longer to fall asleep later and awoke more frequently but that may be risk you have to take behind strange sleep course the only solution that will always work is time the homeostatic and need to realign and while the ways of beating jet lag can fast track the process it still time was by friend of the existence further research of which was unaware way to reset your sleep wake cycle is to stop eating you fast for about to your body clock will reset with whatever time you break your fast as morning the lu paper in the mechanism though more recent paper that the al are inconclusive tibetan buddhist of fabric strung together in blue white red green yellow crisscross the of bare limbed the gentle wind them flutter gold light into the grassy meadow touching row of canvas and the temple house beyond of is the seat of the in the tibetan buddhist monastery established nine ago spent the past weekend there the field work office at my college this retreat every semester to who previously wonderful about it this semester one of my told me she was going should join her like learning new so up good decision return all chill and as one friend told me his roommate had but certainly few new and to mull over and dipped my hand into previously unfamiliar piece of the world for one mind the first evening the twenty something most from my college four from another in the shrine room sitting cross legged on as we to introduce tibetan buddhist philosophy by telling us not take any of what say on faith it through analysis if there is some benefit in it for you he said is like drugstore full of medicine do not go to the drugstore and buy everything in it you just buy what would be beneficial to you now believe the other medicine may have just as much value but in other not this one the the of the of the four noble karma the six we about the giving and how one should try to give what one could to other sentient in the form of material kind protection and so on story of the buddha and how the buddha had given his flesh so that family of hungry could eat fellow student one life for another being is the ultimate gift he and shook his head if you feel no regret he said you feel regret it the merit then preserve your own life and do not give away anything that would cause you regret struck chord preservation above all else unless the right situation and understanding to the resident nun about psychology and cognitive science had studied psychology for while in grad school but now the view that are going about understanding the mind and understanding the knower and what knowing is the wrong way she said study the brain and the self externally since the their science been about observation of behavior of electrical brain activity the mind can only be known by you the person whose mind it is said philosophy and epistemology were doing it right looking at from the inside big overlap between tibetan buddhism psychology and cognitive science three examine the distinction between the self and between the observer and the between knowing and the knower agree with to some extent only so much can be known about the mind from external observation this mean that there merit to such nor that nothing of use can be learned in that way tibetan buddhist philosophy also the mind and the self from the inside second session sutra about king who received advice from the buddha sutra into some about the nature of the self whether the self is delusion and how the clinging of self is defilement intend to discuss it in more depth later so stay tuned training and prayer the afternoon group of us outside for meditation session with melted lazily through the tree above breeze animating the so they between our and anger were the session the key message there something you can do why are you unhappy do it there nothing you can do why are you unhappy several off session and one on session

post on the topic of the day was making prayer as someone many people may share those with you the prayer flag your prayer with everyone else in the world may do no good at all but it may if everyone and and and perhaps it will do good may not if no one their it will certainly do no good on the that it will help why not done weekend me that not done learning stay still long enough if relatively constant level of happiness and satisfaction forget that can and should continue to seek out new and and incorporate beneficial into my life person is never done and so continue to observe and discuss and study trying to pick the in which change and trying to make tomorrow better than today onward and ever upward control efficacy and not one to make mean sure could take my pick of popular could decide on the first day of the new year that this year start more and eating better or that spend more time with my family and or that learn new skill if chose to make be far from alone survey on found that of the polled had made at some point though only to keep them about self control the question of the and of the school of at columbia is this how many person will set and how successful person will be at those few in to look at the relationship between self control goal setting and goal achievement that what you believe about self control the you set and achieve the paper self control is used to mean sense of discuss various lay of self control that the amount of self control person can be seen as either an inherently limited or unlimited resource and that this resource can be seen either as malleable or as fixed the amount of self control person can change over time or not important premise to note here is the idea that the probability of choosing goal or making resolution if person that goal can be if you think you be able to achieve goal you re more likely to set it this with of self control and in general if you believe you have unlimited of self control you set number of you believe self control is malleable but limited you set also discuss self efficacy belief in one the ability to carry out desired action propose that people with high self efficacy people who believe that failure is the result of insufficient effort and thus exhibit commitment and persistence will achieve more of their than people with low self efficacy who tend to view failure as the result of deficient ability and thus may simply give up the the first study all college each read one of four lay of self control passage two the first self control either as limited or as unlimited and the second self control as either malleable or fixed the then about their belief in each of two by second questionnaire to assess motivation in which they listed all their current the study was testing whether belief in unlimited malleable self control would result in most and indeed this is what was found the had some about natural in relation to the they read however so in study two the order of the two lay and motivation goal listing was varied from new revealed that as if the motivation questionnaire were assessed first then among the people who self control is malleable those who also self control to be unlimited limited set more lay were assessed first this result reversed the people who that self control is fixed were unaffected by order the third study on to examine goal achievement measure to look at self efficacy the study had two sessions in november then february the first session the read about lay much like in study one but with longer to strengthen the manipulation listed the they were on making at rated how disappointed they would be if they to keep their and filled out individual difference which included self efficacy scale successfully returned for the second session during which they how much success they had had at keeping their does this mean for your the made by across all were qualitatively similar take look at any list of popular and you see the majority of the as shown in the first two more were set by people who believe self control is unlimited and malleable than by any other people that is if you expect more success you may increase the difficulty and number of that you set for yourself efficacy did not have significant effect on goal setting as far as success goes only the interaction between lay theory and self efficacy was significant in limited self control and were low in self efficacy they to give up more often failing to achieve their if in unlimited self control self efficacy had no effect just as many regardless and people who set more were marginally more likely to succeed realize that their research does not directly look at the relationship between lay of self control and about one own amount of self control and self efficacy and propose this as an area for future study in general lay about self control can determine how much success you expect and thus how many you set and self efficacy can determine how much success you actually have will of of on and of athletics or no matter of balance varsity may soon receive academic credit for in their sports during the school year proposal been in the works for nearly two and at long last are voting to approve it to not approve it but the former more likely as member of the and as long time varsity athlete you might say have particular stake in the proposal all could get half unit semester for up to four typical class is worth one unit and typical physical education course of any level is worth half unit with maximum of two physical education counting toward graduation can receive credit for in other extracurricular faculty such as the orchestra the choir and the repertory dance so why not varsity athletics friend over at carolyn from the above standpoint sure it fair to give credit to you get credit for introductory classes you should get credit for varsity athletics our school newspaper other in favor which carolyn are highly unjustified top of everything we must remember that varsity athletics present considerable time commitment is rare to find another activity on or comparable daily rigor and frequent overnight obligation regularly travel throughout the northeastern to participate in and often gone from campus for an entire weekend at time you know what it certainly to travel to boston for an all day competition on the same weekend as good friend birthday party fascinating sounding lecture dance party and seventeen other campus no one in their right mind would ever want to miss agree with carolyn the reason participate in my sport is because enjoy it more about other do those instead being huge time commitment is not valid reason for credit carolyn supporting example that higher level with more difficult and plentiful homework are worth the same amount of credit as introductory level this point home she backed up by our school system of instead of credit in its most basic form one unit of credit per semester course regardless of difficulty in class and subject relatively unique in its credit system to dan the rationale behind such system is to try to send the message that all are equal in worth and that one shouldnt try to distinguish between based on time spent in or out of class the reason time commitment is is because according to the of the article the faculty must consider what it can do to mitigate possible academic on these no don think the faculty any obligation whatsoever choose to be varsity of their own accord they can manage to balance their athletics and their then perhaps they should reconsider in varsity sport in the first place get special simply because they re like the fact that even though dedicate huge of time to my sport more time than dedicate to any single course at least while in season can still keep up with my who are taking comparable course minus the sport must be made sure party on friday night or overnight travel to competition the question is what more important to me learn stuff too the article will continue to be to the rigorous academic the athletics credit could discourage varsity athlete from unnecessarily taking on five academic while in their athletic season the varsity credit the athlete seeking to assume five in his or her athletic season will be checked with an overload form thus encouraging the student to think twice about assuming such large academic and extracurricular load like to be known that who have trouble balancing tough course and time consuming have always had the option of taking lighter load or dropping an extracurricular the option of varsity unit to the list make much of difference who varsity could add an easy course instead who can balance their work and their sport will continue to do so let it be known varsity don have to take half unit for their sport thus the need for an overload form if taking five carolyn in response to the above quote that in sports is optional and should always take second place to mostly are officially what college is about are what get graded will in part determine what they are able to do with their are only one particular kind of knowledge carolyn statement that student can learn more important from than from participation on sports team though some of the most important learned about persistence goal setting success and excellence effort teamwork leadership these learned from my sport and my different kind of knowledge than what one typically gains in an academic course yes it no less important that think is the best reason for credit for varsity athletics and the of the an travel america is swath of and that during the and now lie well as empty of glory days past among these is the center of american automotive was when the car simultaneously already plagued by corruption and crime saw its unemployment rate skyrocket in left behind when an economy real estate that what read article about some forward thinking artist who bought house in for of us and lots of pay that much in rent every month fact the article went on soon nearby house went on the market for the artist notified their who in post haste was house if it was real fixer upper even if you really were better off tearing it down than living in it that still be hell of deal out in where you can still buy unincorporated land with no water or you pay at least for house sized plot of dust how can you buy an actual home for literally than dirt the of this were fascinating had of from coast to coast converging in building new city on rock roll pictured young fixing up saw community art transformation of city could take that oil soil and those and create something new and beautiful going for thought what would you have to lose by moving to so and did some research and came up with list of selling for under grand had plenty to choose from there were more cheap than we would have time to visit picked two to cruise and dove in once we the truth hit fast this is modern american ghost town the place is practically deserted streets built wide to accommodate heavy traffic are mostly empty and are up painted up bombed out and falling down in the center of the business district there no traffic and hardly any people don believe me it got worse as we drove into residential looking for those cheap fact never felt so out of place in all my life in south where we five white people in an hour felt fine just driving around not so in it about race it was about being naive was about driving down streets where we truly did not belong and were not welcome is ghost town and it inhabited by the only people left here are those who can or won leave live in deserted in with front and missing sit on the porch and watch the go by watch the go down watch their crumble we driving through slowly and reading house in late model stuck out like couple of we sped up and went straight to the we stopped to take photo but mostly we and have each lived happily in the of but the danger felt in was like nothing experienced before was actually afraid for my life the correspondent wrote that his friend mitch home had already been stripped of its and wiring for mitch that only added to its appeal because he now had the opportunity to renovate it with solar heating solar electricity and low cost high efficiency as for the house some work hole some don know what part of these live in but the saw more like this see abandoned in this town get set on fire no we went in those one in four had been one corner we saw giant banner hung across front porch slow down to take photo but paraphrase that they obviously who live in this part of town are on their own although and many would love to own even fire scarred condemned building the fact is that we last week here house in and you get lifetime supply of sleepless nights you spend the next several waiting for and and to break in the like the without the scenery the gold and the hope the do believe that change will come to will be green movement here in fact it already being cultivated by forward thinking and intrepid day this place will be reborn right now the story of is any artist type who into this part of is probably pretty handy with pistol or shotgun who this plunge is their life every day betting on future that may take long time to arrive story short you can buy house in for you will get what you pay for to toby who inspired my trek to and who in happier greener future may your every dream come true sir and your book sell fabulously to and the of the at post you for this need that at am track down and watch movie to by full of this imagery and about the fire and and the post industrial devastation that the city since poignantly it about which attention on another city with this level of devastation and how without single catastrophic event to blame for it decay gone unsympathetically the movie up by observing this how abandoned and are being by nature the pop fiction which the concept of post human world and how it already now about how if you re pheasant that not such bad thing lot more to than that are industrial being turned into low rent artist and business at the russell for one example are that refuse to cave west of around whole bunch of nice stuff happening along the from downtown up towards there always come to take them there our in the river park of green space with zoo botanical garden and conservatory rentable paddle and of other neat stuff time you re in please head over and entry is free so it available to anyone regardless of economic status re liable to see gathering and and deer cautiously wandering the edge of the hundred of each other of that cheap real estate too horrible either whole street being taken over by between moran and of the they done down there are amazing and the community garden is great bridge to the surrounding neighborhood few ago someone broke into their shed to steal their garden think about that for moment and don have enough pawn value to be worth carrying out took that stuff is probably it in their own garden got more than its share of bad you re right lived in the area my whole life and there are can call them down there where don feel safe in daytime much less at night there are bright and behind every one of them is person or bunch of people who refuse to give up jessica at am for the comment and the great information are exactly the kind of person who me back the hope lost on my way into town there pretty solid group of who are truly to the city and that beautiful to see the fact that people are stealing garden though it still sad that they need to will absolutely watch thank you for the recommendation when in the area again go out to and think long hard about the future of american as sure you do occasionally too at growing up not far from myself would point out few in right now probably really going to get you with open arms there wee bit of loyalty to the and driving foreign car really scream solidarity to those struggling to survive of the funny you got were less about your color than about your ride think but be more serious that is visceral reminder for people of how the american consumer left in the dust proper been dying for long time before the even going to take some to start those of innovation creativity and vision its not going to happen with the investment of into single house will need to begin by an urban oasis that some of the that you had while driving through the city where to buy place where you can feel safe on your own front porch the freedom to sleep soundly without worrying about your copper wiring for all that is wrong with and that nearly everything you be by the pride that have for their city lack the to build her back to her former glory but she won be abandoned for all of those who are trapped there by their there are just as many who insist that they live anywhere else at you for the opportunity to see post era through the prism of your vision never been there but ever since that mad possessed american had been by no even before that the often been america least pretentious masterpiece joyce carol in the like gertie and and john and my favorite john henry left the to go wrestle with the leviathan in they were in it to the death won be the death of the courage of those early it like will prevail after all love what you are doing at am this the monument left behind for the world to witness by this the greatness they built on earth this the proof that all deserve democracy and its inevitable and capitalism die in war to bring this to other american class less society is the final phase the glory of america greatness this show our system superiority over the in the old we really

movement be me to jessica this have the touch city in america firmly in control and forever you said you were naive you jessica at it in writing not and don much approve of the so we re clear on that don think you present fully informed argument on the of urban decay but don disagree with you not particularly interested in whose fault this mess is rather choose to focus on how we re going to clean it up where the green movement comes in and when say green talking not politics you got some fancy new technology at that can do more for people health and happiness and for less cost than victory garden can do please let me know at checked greed sloth and waste were all pretty universally human and see no around either or even anarchically green at heart agree like country music have disappointed me too many times in the past for me to keep on listening here the thing are due to the planet trying to kill itself salmon have forgot how to screw in post alaska are their own chemical burned out in pain the patient is earth and it not getting better want to yell at which insurance company up or change bedpan so to speak times of crisis which this is the who will create positive change are those who accept the hand they are dealt and act the who are educated and informed and attached to moral will be perfectly to deal with world that no longer ask the who left after the first war to cry over the past ask my paiute grandfather even salmon who still my and me not to let us blow each other off the earth until we clean up the mess we have made was for at alone in my presence at when say green talking not politics eric at is now house for listed on realtor helena at told me about this but it to be seen to be not that believe you the country in the world fred jan at don forget about the back may at am find this topic fascinating was born in suburb of and most of family still there will be going back to visit in june plan to take tour of these especially the old have the urban explorer fascination the main reason to post was to say to the have the touch that is classic and must agree with and so true man great and great brad at too checked out few for under and was absolutely at the property house which could be fixed up into maybe house comes with tax bill of per year the on my house in an urban area of mississippi are only year even if you cash for the house you probably want to carry some homeowner insurance with all the inherent to the property arson vandalism and sure it sky high given those bob is if and only if this entire copyright notice is included october to and listen as the audience and at stupidity at least she losing again sarah successfully turned seat to you know marxist seat job re genius under christine sarah bob october this same accusation on today that the audience is laughing christine on the first thing she but disagree entirely point are laughing at it absolutely got laugh the sort of no laugh you hear from studio audience when the slightly stupid but affable and hitherto ineffective finally in on the lead that at least half the audience in venue like this would be there to support and the to of and state in the dig is virulently popular in the from whence comes the those are and of for supposedly one over on they laughing at her may very well have been gasp and some uncomfortable that enough now at the end but the at the top of the clip are her not her by at october by at october don think the audience is laughing at the laughter an incredulous oh my god sound to it it obvious that they re laughing at him not her she the reaction she out at the audience with big grin she just scored on is right separation of church and state in the is major talking point routinely claim that the establishment of religion clause mean what everyone else it although this what an extremist nut is it not really gaffe it standard stuff right out of their playbook by at october if one is looking for the phrase of and state yeah that not in there so at me big and my pants the principle is in there love when ignorant like and her little make huge category like this is akin to taking tour of college and starting it off at the administration and when that part of the tour is finished someone like ok that great but when are we start seeing the college by at october it standard stuff and would have of it that what saying as far as she concerned it not gaffe and as far as in the room are concerned it was not only gaffe it was should have that would have settled this matter for good convinced that not laughing at her that good one her by at october its already being that it was that was so the last laugh on that by at october don believe this was public event elvis think it was debate before the at the law school mean it could be some of her but truly believe there would been lots of if that were the case by pea at october you have point there but still the laughter sound incredulous to me it appreciative and yourself in non partisan school position you laugh at loud at like the one she or would you mutter grumble to yourself whispering to your colleague idiot don see crowd like that laughing out loud at such pitiful little it not even worth laugh out loud guffaw by at october well keep in mind that all of them probably know what freak she is think it might be more of holy crap can believe she just topped all the other stupid she said and got to bear witness to it laughter know if had the opportunity to attend sarah rally be to hear some incredible stupid falling out of her mouth by pea at october which would be sarah rally by pea at october the debate was at really think are going to laugh at rather than chance in hell by at october from actually audibly the crowd gasp political scientist said after the debate that it raised about grasp of the professor who in constitutional law said that while there are about what as government promotion of religion there is little debate over whether the the federal government from making religion genuinely that the principle of separation of church and state from the and think to many of us in the law school that was surprise said one thing to not know the or some of the but most do know the of the respond to who her to clarify her after the debate by ben at october who is only it not fact is so stupid so utterly brainless uneducated ignorant and unread they should immediately be on the slim chance that there genetic component to their imbecility who stubbornly so little about science cannot possibly be to develop the analytical necessary to interpret by at october the laughter was with her then the joke is on everyone there in support of course because later after she basically pounding the desk talking about the constitution and her unyielding devotion to that which does not separate church and state ha ha she can recall the and and needs to be by the questioner the real busted moment here if you ask me for people who speak so militantly about to the constitution expect military like response to such simple question will turn blue about christian nation and constitution but not knowing two as person running to uphold and defend the constitution those this clip her and the faithful as constitutional knowing what the constitution when is bold font black over white no grey area here as defender you can say well she church and state are indivisible so do you can say she the constitution when she clearly does not as someone trying to get government job with great where the qualification is basically take this constitution and defend it with your life spend an awful lot of time tearing it up and the to their acquired argument the separation of church and state is dessert before dinner off topic been spending lot of time on potential swing vote fact to fiction hilarious when who for twice and the majority of the way through approval among was pretty consistent are telling me about all the and their loving wisdom to those less in the know you think was good enough to vote for twice and you re one of the million people your and insight like christine are comical at best no mistake laughing you people by at october the laughter was with her then the joke is on everyone there in support of course because later after she basically pounding the desk talking about the

man voice say my god after that and his tone is can believe she said something so incredibly stupid they were laughing at her as is appropriate by irish at october beyond to me as someone who studied who on the the national level on it in law school and who an article on it to hear people who clearly haven done the first of these talk about it as if they know better than do what the and is all about had over at tell me know what was talking about vis vis the need for interpretation and he that any and all must and can only be resolved by not by judicial review before proudly proclaiming that he had never gone to law school and despise the legal profession do you go from there by at october this their view of the and by that mean they regard it the same way as they regard the bible document that is not to be but merely to the letter because it was handed down to us by greater and like the bible that we mere are not supposed to question or interpret they let us know what it really and that will often conflict with what it actually try to exert some sort of control over it meaning by elevating it to level that it untouchable them it not living document that was designed to change with the nation but essentially in stone like the and unchanging for you know maybe an amendment barring gay marriage in order to regain some control over their that they firmly believe they lost they re now trying to determine with unwavering certainty that we all been doing this wrong the whole time and if we just get back to what the everything will be em few though re waiting on an reply from the washington re at to hand down some by at october answer to your question where do you go from there recently come to the conclusion that the answer is nowhere used to be against making blanket about the hard core tea like the person you they re not all crazy they re not all hateful but lately over it they don believe in evolution climate change the of education public education in order to pay for police and they believe the is not an american they see no problem with racism and fascism they don understand that freedom of speech mean freedom from they confuse losing an election with tyranny they horde food because beck told them so they conflate their movement with the civil movement they detain on public property for the crime of you don reason with people who believe these any more than you try to reason with they re crazy plain and simple and it really really sad by at october to disagree buddy the debate was at school at her the second time as well when she incredulously as if not believing in the don think they were laughing at him they were they be after his comment and probably and calling him liar rather than after her comment by broadway carl at october irish so good to see you hope you re well by at october had over at tell me know what was talking about vis vis the need for interpretation and he that any and all must and can only be resolved by not by judicial review before proudly proclaiming that he had never gone to law school and despise the legal profession is nowhere to go with these would not believe you if you parted the sea for them first learned my lesson at it can be personally satisfying to present all your little in row they will never stop erroneously knocking the damn out of line by at october know she had better watch out the separation between church and state is what us from think those trying to diminish the separation are probably secret that are sneaking in on us by ron at october convinced that the audible and were from her attempt to bluff her way through an exchange regarding the in room full of art people not running to win and if you think she is you re not paying attention by at october think of those bill clips the constant television for the last decade or so think of who endorsed her and how could teach her thing or two about moderate ad the strategy is this be as foolish as possible so no one you actually knowing anything the derision and or ridicule on the circuit as passionate advocate for whatever cause you choose to opt case it the same pseudo christianity holy dignify to play within the political arena case it the fascism that within the the fool no one with their talk of independence and the theatrical in fighting always tame those they let in their or they destroy them her place as do they all you really think serious candidate would go around for during debate is not that stupid know some of you want to think she is for the sake of mirth and merriment but she like stupid enough to confuse with fun all you want but at least be realistic with yourselves you have just as much fun as they re me all they are it running on personality alone nothing more nothing less politics she booster same as with in nevada the chicken lady and were merely supposed to challenge and beat reid then get out of the way is to be face for the underdog is why they re not making full investment in her place is not in the senate but on television by at october elvis watching the video several times have to disagree the audience was clearly laughing at her and her ignorance she clearly she that she scored huge win and that the audience was on her side more of her complete separation from reality by at october and their reaction from the fact that she the subject again after the moderator on question was the equivalent of re the when staring at the document especially in that setting did it on purpose not to further the discussion but to establish that yes she is dependable telling you all she running game by at october have to disagree with your assessment that this is all game and that she not that dumb don believe she as dumb as she is ignorant if really is game for then what the end game may have flown under the radar for her previous but now she made herself fool in the national spotlight and effectively ruined any chance of her charade if her intention was to be lifelong nominee in the first place perpetual campaigner can only get you so far and if they don intend to win after getting the nomination then that con game is limited more into the realm of your assessment but if she and in her shelf life is limited too by broadway carl at october hi good to be back been due to baby little was born on couple of early but he doing well goodness for and maternity leave by irish at october you misunderstand me not saying she damned thing about the fact go far as to say she give one damn about it saying is that going into these she fully aware of her tell the truth can tell you her actual per se but if had guess it would be an extended stint on cable news channel the shelf life of both is only limited to the fraction with which they uphold standard took out of the equation when she quit her job she to actually run it would be for vanity sake reaching for what already both themselves to being for so conservative did anyway attribute part of my assessment of to from good friend of mine that knew her on the media circuit at the start of the decade friend her as bad actress primarily that but necessarily cling to it as some may believe friend me that christine believe half provocative and or boneheaded she saying is as normal conservative woman by my friend am convinced personally that just starved media personality that found new gimmick in running for public office is the choice she made and she sticking with it of the innuendo surrounding her me to this conclusion as well can be too conclusive know what being too much of stuffy doctor that smile she after about the may very well be her being in on the joke she making of herself not the fact that she tried and to dictate content within it the fact that she knew she did not know and said what she said regardless not try to make sense out of anything of this if you re not thinking like celebrity of whatever quality let say what you do gather all the that you can from through all and see if her point of view beyond the con blather or the crank conspiracy ask yourself why she to be to these public exactly is she to these all my cable news watching seen far more dim than with regular so it not the fact that she dumb that her on television friend me of certain like have that them the leeway they need to raise their public profile they really have no one to answer to they can go on television and say anything get away with it and do it again in yet another venue perpetual cycle not to win anything telling you see how immediately her don believe that was because she beat the establishment candidate fact my theory is that so much as her as limiting her role within the media environment thinking she aiming to be on on regular basis all comes from my observing her debate as well as her more recent not so much running for office as she is to be regular voice for the reaffirmation of been at this for while and they have younger more and dim witted about taking time away from them but she her own which have yet to be revealed though they may be all too obvious by at october christine is certainly ignorant in the sense that while perfectly aware that there are many she know she is as to how that might be an impediment an odd combination knowing you don really have solid grasp on subject but still being convinced that one core are enough to overcome any obstacle in the jesus freak that enough for her is opposed to anything liberal anything progressive anything anything anything that can in any way be determined to accord with the of her savior and lord as his word in any way that enough for her the only reason she gangster is because her brand of theocracy and stupidity would simply never fly anywhere else the idiocy of the extreme right in that gang of who want simple to complex they do not understand she the only market for her brand of incompetent don matter matter matter look at the clips bill of her blithering insistent certainty off all the time and never once not single time ever long enough to even that maybe she the one who get it who don get it the constitutional don know all about the constitution does because she took week long course at oxford she about her academic beyond all reason and truth the actual degree of study she accomplished does not in any way diminish her insistence that she highly educated really knowledgeable about all of these she know about richard know anything about the of evolution he just cranky atheist read pamphlet from the that totally the difference between and which are not the same not at all and anyone who they are is just wrong that court in that found as matter of that the crowd simply used to substitute for resulting in numerous of it is wrong christine is right if you disagree with her then you are properly an object of scorn and derision for being so poorly informed about may not be to may well know that she unelectable in her mind that because the have been by the same evil wrong headed liberal progressive indoctrination that corrupted our our and our society christine have hidden agenda herself as morally correct profoundly right in both of the term and struggling as only loving martyr can against the tide of evil sweeping her nation as for why she consistently to appear on television in that weird sarah way that me recoil in horror and wonder what the is wrong with anyone who would touch those with their worst enemy cock say about masturbation and flirting with witchcraft and insist that these that no one else like the top secret information about to take over the to which only is privy her in the unique position to lecture on henry on foreign policy history richard on evolution lawrence on cosmology and murray mann on particle physics see jebus her think it the result of the move in the and to tell that they were special that no one was any better or any than anyone else that everyone to their own opinion to make sure that everyone who the game got trophy those self inflated self important self esteem crowd are running for office and they are well convinced that they know as much as anyone else and their about are just as valid as anyone else even because it opinion and who are to tell me that don know what talking about don know what you re talking about she going to lose is not the same thing as running lose in the same way that knowing she really know much about the constitution will never prevent her from telling you what it must mean she right today and she will think she right after being to death at the will continue to blither her vacuous on any platform she can find spend campaign money on her rent and go to bed every night feeling as though she is fighting the good fight for truth and america by at october lex for the clarification like you might have an inside track into this person make up still going to think that her smile so much that she in on the joke as it was she really does think she what she talking about is debate after all competition just shrug your and throw hail mary pass with smile on your face would be suicidal really who the hell by broadway carl at october agree with you completely except that believe the everyone is special crowd in the grew up in the and there were no gifted for who happen to drool on themselves back then the entitlement because deserve it generation is currently in their early to mid wife with them all the time at her place of employment by at october the real was disappointed though not to see that today conjunctive law that be on every label on produced from grown in was unanimously by the california as an effort to promote and consumer education effort the new law instead to needlessly sully their package and their own marketing the law does nothing to educate unanimously out of the california and now the signature which it will surely obtain to an sponsor of the bill this new conjunctive law that any wine with an american entirely within like russian or creek must also include the word on the label starting in are in the problem of course is that by the on bottle of wine that is made with grown in russian creek or any other in have any single distinguishing feature derived from the fact that they were grown inside the of learn absolutely nothing about the wine in the bottle no evidence that grown in improving consumer education on each bottle conjunctive will unleash the full potential of our delicious to represent around the world correct in will receive tremendous boost in recognition due to the conjunctive law that to add more wording to their they think the help or hurt their marketing if was making high end wine from the or that in part on the quality recognition that comes these be that forced now to put place name on my label that told my nothing of real value about the wine behind my label and in some demonstrably its quality of the and an outstanding representative for noted this moment the beginning of brand for to come of the new law like to point to similar law that be on all that are made from grown in that appellation rather than simply sub appellation point to the prestige that the designation this prestige nothing to due with the law that in addition to simply be on these to do entirely with the promotional effort that gone into making place associated with great an association will not be made with ever the in simply can make case for any meaning or for region as vast as any degree of quality to the is it important for someone making or to help promote designation that no ability to define the quality or character of the in my or my is an example of usurping the private label real estate and it very valuable real estate for the sake of something that is of little use to private commercial yourself the on one was such great thing why don more who make creek russian alexander or already put these on their label legally could if they to the new conjunctive law is the equivalent of the state of california and the of imminent domain over the of of nick said love it tom found way to tie this in nicely is case of over reaching government regulation costing business unnecessarily and them with more just unnecessary also is social promotion in the sense that great that now are forced to use will be giving some of their credibility to their lesser of wealth redistribution as well august at james said many or of will have to be re to the between now and august at john kelly said be that forced now to put place name on my label that told my nothing of real value about the wine behind my label and in some demonstrably its quality tom am really so is every other producer have this issue with still don know whose are being by this useless piece of crap legislation completely agree with you when you state an association will not be made with ever got real skin in this game are going to have to totally redesign our front label to make room for and so far every mock up is and the impact of our brand best option like we will go to or california for our front label appellation and discuss the grape source vineyard name and meaningful on the back label is going to compensate me for this estimate the value to be in six and we are small winery for winery with better established brand the value is much higher domain is exactly right this is nothing less than governmental taking the who backed this should be ashamed should also expect to lose my vote for them next election august at said tom law is such august at said put in in trade and several of the industry support the new requirement county always was the sheep ranch joke in the era of well deserved early global fame county now is as good or better than those early we have led the world into modern viticulture with the help of and in some pretty good company from other suppose the new law is all sacramento think it will improve revenue and dignity admit have for the bill authoress was in county not too famous for or people sometimes would happen by our place where was where was people always were confused how the somewhat neighboring had such similar after several in county have learned to appreciate its uniqueness for its viticulture and other the town of is on typical route people follow driving from to the ambience in the town is only an enclave it is rightfully of its heritage as village and for its viticultural county much more territory and other within the county are starkly different from the of valley and the town of many people still vineyard la august at nick said in to john of you to comment and good to have dissent do you make of the fact that already are free to put on any label they want cannot mandate marketing effectiveness than it can mandate perception of quality it were effective you already see it virtually everywhere admit don see the reasoning of your argument here the issue of the to is non trivial too as you can see above august at bill said tom wonder what the response would be in and if the in convinced the state government to require california be put on all of wine made within california august at said past few eminent domain become libertarian property since the case concerning urban renewal polemics can see tom too was counterpoint in the label world after some court in company its grape to comply with for in county fruit in order to remain legal in the wine as from rambling article author of the word on the newly designed label of famous budget wine producer cabernet august at said the links for court us vol living wine bunker with dose of trump false august at said what business is it of state government what terminology goes on wine those belong to the federal and the which already in fairly exhaustive detail what goes on front and back and how can the state legislature single out two first now for this treatment are they going to go through the wine one by one august at said vive la re at there is review noir had thought of the with respect to new in thinking the scot might have interest in the bagpipes in the at steve site there is an interesting discussion of his current ongoing with from and easy to get lost in when one is striving for new way all this to approach from slight distance plus the historical between the two premium distinctive varietal county and county heat summation also several ago some of the plant of why county and county were the natural in premium production are many why the new requirement sense from all these september at said sorry keep forgetting the site protocol here is the label guideline link again news concept net september at said so here the real requirement wine with an american established that is entirely within shall bear the designation on the label in type size not smaller than two on of more than or smaller than one millimeter on of or less recall correctly this is almost exactly the same as the requirement for the government warning type size the answer pretty clear to me just add to the government warning september at said and the point to the prestige that the designation this prestige nothing to due with the law that in addition to simply be on these to do entirely with the promotional effort that gone into making place associated with great an association will not be made with ever tom would suggest that all good and bad benefit from on the label it is indeed great example of marketing what you describe as promotional effort the of the law are not doing the job they were hired to do perhaps the needs more passionate communicator on their marketing team together the quality promotion you suggest is impossible with roughly half of the of roughly twice as many gold in national and international wine the fact that their cost less on average and the are less snooty is compelling story to get out to the public if knew all that maybe would be seeking out with on the label suggest that this is bad law that will never be associated with high quality wine in the way is disagree but am eternally hopeful optimistic that the will inject little passion and not more of the same old staid and boring in their marketing have confidence they will change retool improve live up to their worked selling and marketing won for my marketing the story is simple are receptive to it the magic of is easy my take anyway don aim to be but don mind being the sole supporter of the law as born and bred wine guy september at the the the so much at stake for america alcohol and their monopoly status that props up unearned it no surprise they would swing for the with all their state political power and attempt to pass bill currently in would give wholesaler the to turn back the clock on consumer access to wine lead to the passage of that override federal on alcohol kill and business that focus on artisan production of wine beer and punish and dismantle small specialty wine that serve the that won and override the critical principle of single american economic union all for the sake of protecting wholesaler by giving them unprecedented control and influence over the entire american alcohol industry what is truly remarkable and likely result of the stemming from of being government welfare is their willingness to misrepresent ignore the truth and mislead in their defense of the recently is the creation of the and and to be the repository all the misrepresentation ignorance and misleading of could possibly muster for the sake of context and setting the record straight this post address many of the and misleading made at the disingenuous new their system competition with public safety to ensure that can enjoy alcohol without suffering the negative effects of an unregulated there really any competition when the state based regulatory system the love so much require that of alcohol use wholesaler to bring their goods to market meaning that without use of wholesaler producer cannot enter state market also that get to decide what drink not the effective state based regulatory system in the is under attack the past more than have faced in federal to their authority to regulate alcohol and their ability to maintain licensed system of alcohol the only to the state based alcohol regulatory system are those that discriminate against interstate commerce for protectionist in the wake of successful that the protectionist that originally the state extraordinarily broad authority to maintain robust system of alcohol learn more against the brought by those wishing to alcohol for their own economic is of great concern to state alcohol state general public health and many the economic of and are by doing the bidding of who receive more government protection and welfare from the state than any other industry in you might expect them to fight back as for those that have concern let recall that it only tiny fraction of state alcohol that there is no formal support from state general only mere handful of public health selection of of campaign from and themselves that support to recent national poll by the for of support the right of individual to set their own and surrounding the sale of alcohol and agree that state and local regarding alcohol should be decided by and not by say that the center for alcohol policy is an arm of the national beer association and that it would conduct poll that supporting those that funded the poll it get any more illegitimate the page fact fiction bill does not address direct shipping or any specific state alcohol law does not state law that direct shipping does not mandate direct shipping law where there currently is not one the bill does wine shipping law if someone were to challenge it in court by providing the shipping law with the same presumption of validity other state alcohol in the extreme what worse the knew this when they wrote this the ability to pass unchallengeable in court that would discriminate against out of state wine we know such would be into various since have seen to it that such have been into state for the past fact would allow to pass that make receipt of wine by in state legal while making receipt of wine by out of state punishable to greater degree than rape home invasion or selling cocaine to of power to regulate alcohol is not an industry food fight food fight may be the wrong word to call the introduction of what it is an attack on the entire alcohol industry and for the sake of protecting wholesaler no coincidence that large and small spirit and wine education wine and free trade all oppose bill does not amend or alter the federal which federal in many of these no it amend the act it entirely quote from not that the state or territorial law may burden interstate commerce or an act of congress the state law shall be upheld claim by the that does not amend federal on alcohol is straight up misrepresentation like saying kick the dog but rather his fell on to my boot is the intent of this language to make clear the congressional support for the holding in state that allow an in state winery to do something similarly situated out of state winery cannot do that facial discrimination is included in the bill to codify this prohibition have great faith in the ability to mislead this goes beyond even my expectation the intent of is precisely to overturn the supreme court decision that did away with protectionist state alcohol importantly the very language of the explicit right to discriminate against out of state wine the state needs to do is offer the of for yourself state or territorial may not facially discriminate without justification against out of state of alcoholic in favor of in state one of those the bill is maintenance of the structure of the state alcoholic beverage distribution system in other discrimination is as long as the discrimination is written into the state alcohol beverage distribution note that wine are not even covered by this language on justification the state needs no justification to discriminate against out of state half the have been their alcohol the have such as that require face to face transaction for to buy alcohol fact face to face are not for know this because have written that have gone unchallenged that require to be made at the point of delivery of the wine should not set alcohol policy this responsibility rightly with individual state as under the to the never have set policy state always have is the big lie the tell merely tell the state when they have beyond what the that the state in every state where litigation affected badly went about fix the don mean to say that state alcohol should in no way be to abide by the in the next will the argue the amendment give the the right to prohibit from alcohol will they argue that state banning african from being is legal under the state that raise can and should be in the state legislature for it this attitude that the day when crow were in place the would have that the racist separate but equal philosophy had no business being and that we should wait for the that the racist to overturn them with new have precisely to adjudicate with the fairness and constitutionality of state of course know this to have brought to court over alcohol distribution they think were fair or constitutional that don like the involved when the decision don go their way the hypocrisy misleading and being featured at the supporting is staggering they do the right thing when they invite to sign up for that will deliver the latest urge all to sign up for those the mean time please the that spurred the to launch their own is by the and upon reading through it you should find yourself feeling much cleaner and less soiled than after wading through the of the new wholesaler on scott said bad there not way to shout than all try more exclamation july at said tom thanks so much for keeping us all up to date and informed regarding this silly but very real threat not only to our industry but to our basic as july at tom said scott for the my pleasure july at bill said rid of beer and wine distributor ie make them illegal and you would really be showing free market work in progress as resident of ohio want to purchase bottle of wine on line and have it shipped to me in ohio without interference from anyone else july at austin said issue for your link reading your post july at said would post link with cute title related to the post the article is in trade journal available by subscription only law id bill happy hour for july at steve said tom for this passionate polemic and sorely rebuttal to bogus bill july at tom said like some old are filling their with some major getting this bill through blatant anti competition bill that will crush the of the wine industry like mart moving into town and crushing the live in texas have to resort to and grape juice after the take control of the law in the state legislature even get me on the still of this state cant buy on july at said am speechless will not even waste my time you point by point because you do not have clue in many what you are talking about do have few valid but they too may be on false premise do not claim to be the all knowing expert the same sensational you rail against instead of balanced and fair assessment you render the entirety of your rant incredible short the wine to go from point to in some way you work for like you would prefer you government welfare to go there instead compete against each other perhaps you forgot do not operate for instance there are about for on both the supply and the demand side hardly the ideal monopoly situation most where state allow shipping you can get bottle of wine shipped from the winery of your choice very important point to remember large commercial wine may have the ability to market their own wine smaller whom you seem to be so concerned about do not have the proper infrastructure to allow wine on line in many let alone their own transportation infrastructure are at farming and wine which is what they likely prefer to do in most july at said wine are really good about wine october at crystal said informative would definitely appreciate knowing these as being student such help me lot is rather interesting for me to read this for it like such and anything that is connected to this matter definitely want to read more on that soon december at dissertation writing service said is my luck that found your post which is according to my search and topic think you are great thanks for helping me my problem december at for mar by rick look at the fan of some and what you see is not pretty picture the look good but when you dig little different picture filled with off topic at best vile language and real antipathy for the brand at worst of supposed to be good thing yes and no it great several hundred how did you come to get those you earn them through fantastic customer service the brand promise providing value to the community in an authentic and passionate voice or did you run ad campaign and hit the broadcast with promotion look at my old favorite friday you can see this then you might need upgrade or you need to install if it missing from that ad cool right fact as recall they got over million friday fan woody and it pretty good then something not so awesome those their free and they them now friday completely lost control of the page and eventually out lot of free from short term perspective sure they did on the deal came in and ate their food they could have accomplished that with in the mail the newspaper or by an list they decided to go the media route let take look at what the friday like today gone woody and his went poof come guessing it had something to do with the venom and general anarchy the page had by rather than growing them friday page does exist with roughly third of the they used to have friday pretty much had to spray on their relationship with people easy to pick on friday but they certainly the only guilty party think plenty of have the siren call of the ability to target your is really terrific but you re in danger of relationship with that ultimately is built on what have you done for me lately foundation you essentially bought these for the right to target them in the case of friday or other that offer free product or discount you are essentially them again up pattern where the consumer now to be for being your fan with tangible item that is free stuff not bonus item it now standard part of the agreement me as fan me free stuff the point of media to distribute and real fan to engage with brand for whole host of often free product is the least of these not saying that special or surprise and delight ever good thing think when used properly they can be terrific do mean by used properly as reward for people who have engaged with the brand in meaningful way us picture of you wearing brand shirt and sure you free sandwich some and happy to give you all some when enter the relationship feeling they are to free and you re in trouble kathy april at time there was some of the true value of if you have million and they are all well what is the real marketing value soon is now james the rod by rick james is an extremely talented basketball player also very astute individual who how to use the media and various communication to his advantage also to surround himself with people who understand business but starting to wonder if he lost bit of understanding of american culture play college basketball he went straight from high school to the and since joining the he won exactly zero free agent now and tonight he made his decision about which team he going to play for in very public manner with live announcement on this week on and quickly massive following morning he james was of course topic and that was burning as well starting to wonder if painting himself into corner and maybe misread how quickly sentiment can change neal once said won at every level but college and pro but was always than life literally character who was outgoing and had great relationship with one of the been huge hit on have that sort of relationship with think an appropriate comparison might be alex incredibly talented player perhaps the best in the game who went very long time without winning ring making his announcement in this public way only more pressure on himself rod how the media can turn on you when you put yourself above your above the game james now himself in the following position title is immediately wherever he goes winning title will be seen as massive disappointment title will result in some saying that he do it alone put himself in position where if he leaves every other city and will be against him just like alex it no longer the target demographic for most of the but you know what to me live prime time press not self twitter and not on his during the see what the future for know he be rich but how will he be by across the country should have hired along with his coterie of other were to fulfill that role for him would have told him to go low key with this decision and let it be led by his new team sure it clear that the team comes first and that he looking forward to of the team the only thing that is winning championship the main factor the miami and the to rod continue with wade the role of derek so it dan july at am wednesday may the effect of not being on vacation in on man with tall stack of to grade as you probably my wife is currently on vacation without me which is different than vacation from me although given how frequently insufferable am could understand the appeal of the region of which is immediately south of tuscany and full of as evidence of how thoroughly corrupt the region is present picture courtesy of her of the cabin she be in free of charge until july the view she be writing her dissertation to the next two the region is poor though not so much as thought and poorly by and there router up the hill from her which sometimes but only then into loft too unbearably hot to occupy during the day the only opportunity have to talk to her via is that last hour in the late evening when the loft enough to be of course that the strength that evening is strong enough to establish and maintain connection it frequently this post about how melancholy become when haven from her by which would be midnight over there because anyone who me on already that and because this post not my daily descent into written about before but because the wife is providing me with such of the city feel to do so again as noted in that post is not built city so much as an one the to have become an unwitting theme of late course it was built but it was built vertically within the city meaning that new were atop like so the effect is the sort of architecture one only in or of them like the one in the finale of the fourth season of the wherein took advantage of contiguous three walled film to depict harris moving seamlessly from the upstairs bathroom at house the underground bunker from the bathroom across the hall his parent basement into an ice cream truck the the come hither the back of the ice cream truck of passage him to you it his basement which he the same door he originally it from house only to end up in the of and shortly an parody the only difference between what did and is that you could travel through the side streets of with camera and accomplish such minus the without needing to cut once without leaving officially of transportation can venture into and through outdoor university the central hallway of apartment and so on photograph of the dueling for the the wife snapped the other day the way the city can enter the hotel either through the door with the green awning or the second story window of an adjacent building technically true but it accurately how it to those unaccustomed to the city geography the city is even more disturbing though because of the tendency of its to transform into brick when the street becomes too steep for picture is not from the current set as the relative quality and if remember which mean recognize the of amateur the world over who think good photograph is one framed in the most dull and predictable way possible snapped by me only mention that because in the city with the wife and as you probably the real point of this post was to indulge in bit of vicarious before to stack of ungraded that no amount of actual grading to have the power to reduce it even homer no but seriously if that not picture actually took it exactly the sort relentlessly take whereas check out the wife above the woman an eye she is working she is not on vacation this time apart will make you and make you realize marriage is work and you need to put some in or the marriage and you are left with an empty hole in your heart know this is over kill but you need to get out of the funk you are in and grade the and finish the course so you can get some down time and catch up on your sleep by wednesday may at have happy vacation that place fascinating should get passport by wednesday may at happy don normally like to contradict you but in this case must not the one on vacation sadly to live it through my beautiful wife by wednesday may at oh got can wait to get so can watch again like it was the first time by saturday may at carbon offset disappointment april big believer in carbon not so much the cap and trade game but in the simple internalize your externality sort talk about it in my talk we all have an ethical obligation to offset our carbon footprint now wife and have been doing so for couple re couple late for last year reason we re late other than the obvious is the insane complexity in calculating it well travel way too much the biggest chunk to cover to calculate it accurately churning through pile of could estimate no doubt want something more accurate was really happy to see on the page an announcement of it to be was simple way to at least know what the total carbon footprint from your for some period was after all they have all the data and ideally simple way to buy no such luck simple linked to one of the million where you can calculate per flight carbon cost you to input total flown but its page give you total flown it you the total added to your account included forward to version by lawrence on april april peter nice carbon calculator built in have to enter all your but think it generally an exciting system if you don mind the surveillance april point do enter all mine in solution april padraic you supporter of cap trade mandatory scheme going to than voluntary april favor mandatory scheme internalize your externality am suspicious of cap trade like complicated partial version of that by the same genius who gave us the mess on wall street that is designed to generate large finance sense is for simpler system april padraic cap trade you use the financial crisis as an excuse to write off all of economics cap trade system worked very well at reducing dioxide pollution in the finance and all re right that carbon tax is definitely simpler but there are upsides to cap trade as well such as the fact that the market will drive the price up whereas tax won increase unless it to your green culture talk think you are the clip he saying that your money would be better spent on political and that push for mandatory of the instead of on carbon the problem with carbon and other voluntary is that given the finite amount of money energy and attention we have to push for the environment feel like the opportunity cost of these is too high to policy the citizen role that for example would be much more productive if it were global rally for carbon instead we de politicize it and entertain the idea that voluntarily turning off will stop climate change big fan of your work on and corruption but skeptical of these initial into the environmental arena april mark am suspicious of cap trade like complicated partial version of that by the same genius who gave us the mess on wall street that is designed to generate large finance sense is for simpler system just you do not fully understand the cap and trade model or the global financial crisis april you book route on it you how many it will accrue bonus for each leg use it to calculate how many get towards my premier status tiny link they move around from time to time but look for it where the seat selection option is should see this on screen before you purchase the ticket and possibly also after april brad got to site it two one for true flown sort of and one for elite bonus cut and paste into your and it should be fine it does show for the short haul but bet those are mostly so you can fill in the real mileage to on those it should not take long april check into the effectiveness of carbon particularly tree before spending money on them keynote april the only way to reduce your carbon footprint is to reduce your carbon footprint period someone else to do something they are doing already does not reduce your carbon footprint one bit you don believe that and still insist on paying someone else to consume less then please consider paying me wife and rarely travel ride my bike to the grocery store cook from whole and never eat or prepared of our are high and rarely used are both ten old and we

over ten thousand square of consuming would gladly accept the sum of fifteen thousand from or anyone else to offset his carbon heavy return would submit to an audit of my and would issue him certificate the amount of his carbon offset april eric the red for the non crowd modern but just as dumb april we all have an ethical obligation to offset our carbon footprint now is nothing so dangerous as someone with an abundance of self righteousness but very little knowledge harm environment news hi politics tuesday february of the and the european was the most vehement opponent of the practice it probably did more harm than good was an unbelievably inefficient way of reducing she and its effects were impossible to verify addition than half of the money given to selling carbon went on research and administration not the climate but the industry believe it is worse than nothing because it the illusion or the impression in the public that action is being taken while we are not really the task at hand significantly reducing greenhouse gas told are powerful around here it stop listening to your and do some basic research may jason nice to see feedback on the program posted your feedback on my carbon news many are reticent to something in their purchase path as an just as they are reticent to anything in their purchase path the cost for large to make any to their commerce is significant another factor in keeping the type of program you like from being available there is reluctance to share the data for accurate measurement due to potential possibly related to future regulatory the technology is certainly available the type of program you imagine put in place the have been very good for example of go green june check out this great new idea to offset man

holocaust survivor who said she was literally raised by turns out to be just regular if depressed person margaret seltzer the author of and the highly memoir about her life as half american half gang banger been been as fraud the vividly told book seltzer wrote about her african american foster and who the gang when they were and her making drug for gang at age and how she was given her first gun as birthday present when she was seltzer told the last week of the first did once making drug money was to buy burial plot like satire of satire is my favorite line in the whole article sarah the editor at who worked with seltzer for three on the book said she was to discover that the author had lied love that understatement and comic timing seriously you may remember an article last summer that in about of race in post on the subject here was one of most important from the article craig black book will come up for consideration and there wont be anyone of color to put in an opinion or be one who shouldnt bear the burden alone we all pretend were the only one embarrassed by that the end result of such one can only fear could be that the only people of color that get are those that do not challenge white can help but wonder if seltzer book with all it far fetched tales from the urban jungle flair would have the smell test were it read by more diverse panel of by read that article in the and thought it was going to be hoax then thought surely after all the she had been to heaven and back sucker too march by michael wow is ridiculous march by sarah wonder why they

on my mind was spending money it was beautiful outside and there were free to do everywhere posted on that was coming to town no than three people told me just had to visit the checked their and instantly fell in love in downtown in an early pioneer in the farm to fork movement and an active advocate for the independent restaurant landscape that the city food is fresh made from scratch sassy and scrumptious cuisine our love of at the table but like the good people of to its own drum the result is unique riff on was convinced but alone sunny sunday afternoon the waiting list was an hour long and and my food stash contents decided to go for it anyway the time finally got seat at the counter was starved took me about thirty to pick out the charleston grilled marinated free range chicken breast on with melted romaine lettuce and cranberry mayonnaise range could dig it for the food checked out the back of the store where their honey and all of for the restaurant plenty of farm to fork and this one may be the best seen at self marketing nothing wrong with it the food in those is probably delicious though question whether the tupelo honey had to come from florida or if it produced locally way it nice to see restaurant built on ethics that also to be incredibly busy of that is surely due to good marketing but the real reason for its popularity is this sandwich was so good found myself eating and with each bite to savor it more completely the potatoes were light and un greasy the were perfectly balanced the chicken was juicy and rich and let be honest here always happier eating dead when know they lived good life found myself silently the chicken for its delicious contribution you chicken will never forget you stopped eating halfway through not because was full stopped so could take the rest home and taste it again later another topic made discovery there in the one which like to share with you now you re going to busy restaurant and want great service bring camera few of the menu the kitchen the food no sooner had taken the above photo when server not even my server at my elbow when stopped eating and my napkin from my lap it took approximately three for someone to take my food away to be up not saying the service before my camera flash was bad because it was awesome wow it sure once to be some sort of food critic or travel writer it just so am even if you re not try this out sometime can guarantee it work but personally will do it probably back it up with stellar review just like the one given the that it could talk about for but it time to move on stop sunny where get down on the the visit to troy post is the first of three part series on bike culture back friday to read about anarchy bike and two wheeled social protest when you got your first bike it christmas present or maybe birthday gift how much fun you used to have on that bike how fast you went how great it felt these days most want an for their birthday their ride around in with talking on their is thing of the past sport hobby but rarely mode of transportation here to tell you riding your bike is still fun and still fast and it the and most socially responsible workout you ever get there are no two ways about it if you give bike that will ride troy met one andrew lynn somewhat of man brain trust and one of his best is the troy in when andrew would ride around town out of hosting work with in his teaching them to fix their and helping them get riding but surely the circle grew and andrew weekly andrew decided to leave town for few schooling in and took over the time andrew returned troy let call it had life of its own days it an established club run by and turning into influence now legitimate downtown sister shop in albany albany movie and pro cycling political and core crew that everything rolling run the gamut from to street to college to the one thing they have in common get it group the value of bicycle more than just transportation bike is statement against fossil than toy it an equalizer that poor to ride with rich than hobby it way of traveling through the world that you interact use your breathe fresh air all for the cost of free bike the shop it was with and anarchist art the space is being donated by some who are also anti capitalist twice week for few the are open to anyone who in are available and will help with advice and knowledge can be had for pittance and you can pick out your own bike from the and of filling the space the main focus of however is not selling the idea is to give people and teach them how to maintain their own bicycle sufficiency is major tenet of the bike movement and troy is training self reliant of all around me college and bike with their older man for on tuning his racer young came in to say his last bike was stolen and he new one and despite andrew stern reprimand that he just walk in every week and leave with free bike he did just that dad came in with his three all of whom left with but first they all sat down and worked on their new together as we left at the end of the workshop woman up to andrew love what you do she said have whole bunch of to give you ultimately is about more than just about building community and quiet but inexorable social movement is not the world first bike collective in fact it only one of many that have stealthily sprung up around america are not waiting for change to happen they re it through small positive peaceful too can change the world all you have to do is ride bike at is here which in most great riding weather are you waiting for are cheap you can get one at your local thrift store for have to be perfect just good enough to get you pick one up and ride it to the end of your block keep going if your life four you can use bike for local it to the corner store when you need milk instead of driving across town to the grocery store don like the milk they sell the store owner what you like and see if he carry it you re the world instead of driving to the park hop on your bike and go exploring have to be workout you can just toodle around town and look at stuff if you re gym buff trade workout for bike ride you live on major highway odds are you can ride straight from your front porch to someplace interesting vacation rent bike instead of scooter or god forbid and much better for the local flora not convinced think of it this way by riding your bike instead of driving your car you re reducing your consumption of fossil can even calculate the money you save on gas and keep it in jar for rainy day to get involved tend to be pretty anarchic but if you look around your community you find both bike and shop who ride for change find bike community your own to the karen at what great

on the trouble with eating local on cape an travel is part of part series on tourism impact on cape about death carnage in the shell shop find out about the friendly food scene look at the pretty pretty sunset or continue on david look like farmer his long hair scruffy beard and shirt he fit in more at show than behind plow are deceiving and david comfy mien passion that is the culture of northern cape wit in david launch the an event that all and brought huge to local the nursery provider of and he the lush green spot in hollow of david and his partner arthur work year round growing heirloom and hardy and to sell at market david and inspired agrarian whose passion for farming him optimistic farming on the cape is the sort of sisyphian challenge that can wear anybody out the hard truth the soil of is not strong enough to support agriculture fertilization it shockingly fast david out patch of sand with thin strip of fertile loam along the edge season it was fertile bed but it was left un as an experiment is what david have to keep feeding it organic material or it turns back into sand plot was test run left untended for single season year rich loam is now useless sand always been this way in the cape is really just spit of sand but still lived here for marsh hay used to be local tradition in this area at each spring tide the local community would head out to the and to harvest the was salt marsh marsh hay no weed and it compact as heavily as other of hay it an excellent and bountiful source of compost and it was used for as soil enricher had to happen regularly david so much oxygen in this soil any added compost burned up in six the get soil left for two without fresh compost will become you it sand the only way to keep going here is to keep steady flow of compost coming in of hay and that lot of work year david and arthur brought in semi truck loaded with leaf mulch worked but it cost money and it fast into the hungry ground long term plan bygone times the whole town of would pitch in on days now david on his own that community support it nearly impossible for him to harvest hay often enough to keep the farm green in the market lovely produce but little of it was grown on the cape official population of tourism industry that millions of each year folk marvel at the quaint of the cape its idyllic beauty and simple then they go out to eat if were interested in sustainable food they totally don care they be hard to find locally meal david produce at her restaurant but it only up portion of her the rest to be shipped from the can squeeze blood from stone and you can get big vegetable from sand of story not exactly david giving up in fact he got and to refashion farming community the and the ongoing experimentation with and at david alone he got the support and companionship of growing group of the young and of can organize they might just be able to get local agriculture back on its main opponent the tourism and real estate which insist upon turning every arable inch of the cape into somebody the same population that would consume the food produced here is actively its production no surprise there all what the point of farming on the beach to on at am someone could start bedding the outer cape with this know they could would be even better for the system would also make it more profitable the would be have to be standing on the acidic sand all of the time the straw hay could also be form of supplemental food for livestock which been used in before times the straw should be from the manure and dried in the air then by it is more ready to be mixed with the soil in the spring soon is now and and and by rick tough to kill the vampire genre was on the other day but also and in the mix seem different to me than other the was dead after the spoof at in then the anne led revival brought it back technically the book with the was in but gain widespread popularity until later it the shark with the tom brad movie based on the anne novel in bubbling below the surface was and other genre then hit and now are hot were done with horrible like american ninja or with starring chris beverly ninja and yet ninja become replacement word for expert to the point where it almost accepted parlance search for turned up more than the term in their ninja is one of the most popular on can put away now after the of the caribbean flick right no actually if we learned anything it that genre just go back underground for get the are like pun intended they just keep coming back to life it not just matter of knowing when to jump off the merry go round it knowing when and where to jump back on you off would you have known to jump back on in time to publish literary it before got deal you were off would you have gotten back on it time to publish and don think you can get off any of these you have to triangulate your decision across several of popular culture triangulation that to revolve around the audience young adult mature and sub genre comedy horror fi and then the actual quality of the content what sort of matrix board do you have to create to know that comedy horror video game will work but young adult time show won can you can do is hope you bat and that when you fail you fail fast the you broaden your scope bit think it would be difficult to find time over the last or so when any of these four have level of bubbling popularity via comic video music all you re looking at is or content maybe it like they re dead but they may be flourishing elsewhere and like virus they re just waiting for new host to carry them to the they all have to calibrate their based on so many and yet even with access to sophisticated data it often comes down to human gut instinct that something is going to work at is the based partly on historical evidence that people like but also partly on the notion that this particular iteration will have new twist that will bring new people into the zombie and tent waiting for someone to make ninja if they can make and anything is possible post was inspired by recent post by grant sure you read that one too matthew july at don know about ninja but there is game where you can play to become and ninja by is quick minute card game for can find more information on our do have an expansion which will add among other to the mix will be more about that

the opportunity that you have given my wife and our family and hope that this story you to regain your the tuesday november page recession face brutal thrive jim collins man in his early recently me what recession like an entirely alien concept to him he grown up during the economic boom in modern memory question drove home the fact that we haven faced severe protracted economic setback for nearly leaving us terribly unpracticed at dealing with tough times this recession long in coming perhaps long to stay now officially upon us it is imperative that corporate relearn key lesson about how great and great people deal with difficult times differently from how they deal with merely good lesson is the peculiar psychology shown by those who emerge from tough times not just intact but jim was the highest military officer in the prison camp during the many times during his year imprisonment lived without any prisoner no set release date and no certainty as to whether he would ever again see his family shouldered the burden of command while fighting an internal war against his and their to use the for propaganda one point he beat himself with stool and cut himself with razor deliberately himself so that he could not be put on video as an example of well prisoner secret intelligence information with his wife through their knowing that discovery would mean more torture and perhaps death his release the first three star officer in the history of the to wear both aviator and the of can understand then my anticipation at the prospect of spending part of an afternoon with who to be at the across the street from my office when taught at preparation read and the book he and his wife wrote to chronicle their those as read the book found myself getting depressed just so bleak the uncertainty of his fate the brutality of his then it on me am sitting in my warm comfortable office looking out over the campus on beautiful saturday afternoon getting depressed reading this and know that he out with his family and becomes national hero it depressing for me how on earth did he deal with it when he was actually there and did not know the end of the story never lost faith in the end of the story said when him never not only that would get out but also that would prevail in the end and turn the experience into the event of my life that in retrospect would not trade say anything for many and we continued the slow walk toward the faculty club limping and arc swinging his leg still stiff from repeated torture make it out that easy he said the the don understand said completely confused the they were the who said re going to be out by christmas christmas would come and christmas would go they say re going to be out by easter easter would come and easter would go then and then it would be christmas again they of broken heart another long pause he turned to me and said is very important lesson must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end which you can never afford to lose with the need for discipline to confront the most brutal of your current reality whatever they might be conversation with had profound influence on me but never really considered it business lesson until my research team to wrestle with the question of why some rise from difficulty to become great while emerge from those exact same and dispirited found that that great corporate version of the for example found itself in the recession losing every business day with in under water thought which was getting on its mortgage portfolio but paying on the debt it was david and his team never in their aim to not merely survive but also to prevail as great company they the brutal fact that the interest rate problem was not going to magically disappear certainly not by christmas they used this grim fact as catalyst for an entirely new business model based on three central of greatness can we potentially do better than any other company in the world can best drive our economic engine best the of our people of to the recession with mindless rebuilt itself based on its to these it investor nearly eight times those of the general stock market how he dealt with the nay and the who wrote off said that it was never an issue inside the company course we had to stop doing lot of stupid but we never the possibility that we would fail were going to use the calamity as an opportunity to remake into great company the sad truth is that most executive won respond that way to these dark days of uncertainty of this recession as an opportunity to fundamentally rethink their business and rebuild culture of discipline the will simply lay off bunch of people and liquidate their cultural equity will hold out false for quick fix only to watch those be swept away by will begin to die of broken heart need not be this way those who lead with the those who retain the unwavering faith that they will find way to prevail in the end but who also retain the discipline to confront the most brutal of reality will find this an ideal time to rebuild and reinforce greatness correctly this recession can be time in your firm history that in retrospect you would not trade wrongly this recession will weaken your and make it that much harder to become great the choice is yours jim collins the author of to management research laboratory in steve steve alexander vice

this together jeff by jeff on jeff by jeff skean richard james steve substantially more version with hard copy on your chair jeff by jeff on jeff by jeff jim was pleasure speaking with you yesterday on our conversation this the following contact to discuss small scale generation on lan on the to distributed generation and on ow to remove those description of the credit that continue to impede ability to sign with power and to resolve them possible for the credit issue are california order that will recover its power purchase through and an amendment to designed to accomplish the same goal have attached talking regarding the california order and propose to believe that an amendment to is the preferable option assessment of the supply demand picture in california for legislative package designed to solve both the and long term electricity crisis in california will deliver to your office tomorrow detailed legislative language those we will also identify that we believe can easily accommodate our language hope that the information is useful do not hesitate to contact if you would like to discuss these further or if there is else that can do to assist you ken to by american in scale on david vice america california san francisco to and by the executive by the on february took step in the right direction stand by have always been designed by the to protect their monopoly position extract monopoly from or both there is no reason to limit he elimination of these to generation that are less than will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it for california to close the significant gap between supply and demand and the risk of black this summer would propose lifting the cap by offering to which is designed to facilitate development distributed generation and related to with investor and municipal the executive order regarding interconnection is step in the right direction to complete interconnection within days california should ensure that this requirement to all generation distributed generation addition the financial the face when generation are simply too powerful to overcome through executive or other the extent possible california should shift control over interconnection away from th utility and place that control with the california could be accomplished through to and of distributed on site generation that is or greater must receive certification from the california an therefore face all of the to development that large scale generation california should ensure that the executive by the to expedite plant and maximize plant output apply equally to smaller scale distributed generation addition distributed generation that is less than to face local opposition the state should ensure that local parochial cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation could be accomplished through to to in to on of the to the by to enter into power with is in active with to establish contract with th goal of entering into power purchase agreement as soon as possible in have significant credit risk that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract understand that the lion share of share risk several for the credit risk and is working with to arrive at solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as template for power purchase going forward of the of the the language in is ambiguous as to whether any authority to charge california for the of power our analysis of the bill the language in to leave intact the california exclusive jurisdiction over in california as such have no assurance that the will agree to include in rat es adequate to cover of power prudence the language in leaves open the possibility that the california could determine that power made by are imprudent the basis of such finding the could then ref use to allow to collect from the associated with its power have no assurance that the will to include in the to cover the of power that into with the that will to of addition to the ambiguity regarding and regulatory authority noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific mechanics that the to to permit to recover its power purchase on our analysis it extremely difficult to determine how the would design the to re its power purchase as currently it is difficult to determine whether would even permit the to include in all of the necessary to fully recover power purchase this ambiguity significant credit risk since have little assurance that will have the ability to recover from the of power to have been working diligently with to resolve the credit have three the which are attached to this would clarify that the would accept as prudent and reasonable all purchase incur red by and the is to include in the necessary to ensure that fully its of power is the preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political standing in the way of attached file doc the in through an by the and through is the option that we are currently working with to implement it is more complicated and could take significantly mo re time to implement than the legislative fix have attached electronic of the talking related to the order that the california would need to issue under this option attached file doc of to as in our letter to we are willing to other of credit from those include letter of credit cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral have to us that to pursue the second is to clarify the in through order and through contract california demand into the california and private sector energy think tank have showing that california severe supply demand imbalance only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available al credible agree that supply will

california supply base currently capacity margin well below the average which is for reliable system in the the more heavily upon hydroelectric power than other are particularly important owing to the of the weather and the dry year the experienced date the event of low rain and snow period the system must possess he flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply california very

reduced number of who can be curtailed under their with the that at the pace of and construction adequate will not be added to correct the market imbalance until at the that california is likely to face approximately of rolling black this summer the considerably more optimistic scenario betting that california will bring an additional on line to meet peaking summer demand is our view that california should view the rosy scenario with considerable skepticism of to california an overview of our legislative solution deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and that we believe can accommodate our as we have throughout the crisis any solution to california crisis must focus on four supply demand truly competitive retail electricity market california to solvency supply vehicle site and construct power plant in texas approximately and have the entire process in other in less than year california it about six or longer the executive and reform are in the right direction can improve tho se by further the that project face in air emission reduction to meet the air permit included in the certification proposal to streamline the process for and between air

getting solution in place in california the supply demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency the best chance of this summer can be accomplished mo st effectively and quickly in two ways down demand california is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the to finance power california could likely reduce demand more economically by running an auction to determine the be willing to receive to reduce their demand for sustained period through the summer could easily run an on line auction to determine the price it could pay for these demand participate would be to have the equipment necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually the an on line auction package that it would be willing to contribute to the effort price to be successful need access to the following key based hour ahead price posting system to track the market price for hour ahead power in real time real time for demand and voluntarily curtailment verification process that for market clearing of

without to the full of hourly market price volatility by passing market price to and them to voluntarily shed load and be for estimate that we could generate summer on peak demand response in excess

state of california provide directly to to fund the installation of advanced and control that would support load curtailment implementation truly competitive retail electricity market the only who were from price volatility in san diego we re who chose and fixed price with energy service that important option away from and is critical that be to remove th prohibition against legislative proposal would give freedom to enter into direct access transaction while simultaneously the about power that might result from customer migration addition california will only achieve competitive retail market when the utility is removed completely from the procurement function is not utility core competency as by the dire financial condition in which the now find themselves california should therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement function entirely with the goal of all by non utility provider within execute the transition california should hold series of competitive over the month period in which service would bid for the right to serve of utility load california to solvency vehicle bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand short bankruptcy does nothing to solve california supply demand imbalance addition bankruptcy the likelihood that and will bear the significant financial of california state government assume the role of electricity buyer for an extended period of time bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidence in california energy and the private sector willingness to participate in that market california can return the to financial solvency by series of staged rate california should design those rate with the dual goal of the to solvency without shocking the economy or household for example california could amortize the recovery of the past debt over year period addition the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways the could absorb some portion of their debt in recognition of the

fine we can pay them anyway received may sent may name steve subject id rice pine rick wrote user of and as far as can tell or can shoot in the foot head if you prefer by setting character set private

are off the remove this feature not sure what the feature in question is but if it something which specify the value to be sent out as the think it bad idea and should be removed or significantly easy mistake to make speak from experience is to assume that the parameter on line the character set used by the entity the message or the character set to be used by the entity the message find that the best way to think about is that it is neither is an octet based used during message transfer it need bear no relation to the or character the most general case message will be composed some native

character set in many not coincidentally all three will be identical but it is very easy to make conceptual implement or just generally misunderstand how is supposed to work if you don explicitly separate in your mind the of character and transmission notice that reinforce this distinction in my own head and in this message by the character set and the situation is much like the canonical situation the fact that the canonical representation is identical to some but not all of the available local be sure selection of and translation to registered is non trivial task and which are trying to adopt right away cannot be for development of such functionality for while just specify non default non bit non is an open invitation to misunderstanding and for now composition which wish to allow to use extended character such as latin but which elect to relegate character set and or selection to the user should either present the user with menu of registered from which to select presumably it will be up to the user to ensure that the editor or composition tool is actually character set corresponding to the selected or in the case of what it like is doing at least filter the user open ended selection against the list of registered and perhaps also the pattern copied this message to the character list subscription to request any traffic should be sent there and not to the list steve to

character set private is almost certainly bad idea used this to defend my action of used an illegitimate do think that all user can shoot in the foot are bad feel quite strongly that the user should be able to specify any old and have display at least at the other end the long term solution is of course to map between character which the use should have control over and which the user should leave alone only request of from all this noise is that of text plain this may be counter to is it the remove this feature no is an octet based used during message transfer it need bear no relation to the or character maintain that specification should be when feasible is because there are such as which translate the octet stream into anything are two to be able to specify new and or extended

might get by gateway don think this is making sense and can find the steve apparently character set text is defined differently from system to system plain text is now with by actually plain text is wide so hear though we could be the high order for much of plain text and that fine by me memory is cheap plain text is now and are handled by the out of band of the data so and and sacred mail is plain text not the most general case message will be composed some native character set automatically to registered and at the other end into native display character set times out of you don care but there that of the time when you it and it although it is still legitimate plain text notice that reinforce this distinction in my own head and in this message by the character set and the situation is much like the canonical situation the fact that the canonical representation is identical to some but not all of the available local this thinking carried into thus this should be the list but refrain up in the use of rather than latin you specify latin then you can must for definition here not an explanation assume that will carry it as or sending and yes sad but true any will strip the high bit be sure selection of and translation to registered is non trivial task is why want and all mail transfer to stay out of it why ask that today we true plain text as leave it alone and let it default at the end and which are trying to adopt right away cannot be for development of such functionality for while let me reiterate that not mad at the nor the not mad at anyone just trying to push point that

and believe that the charter most of the and them well believe that the number of to be covered in one session to be somewhat our criteria for this should be that it illuminate and define the problem

and go with it draft charter the in or think real are in the process of building global directory and other information on the global many of the world it is seen as essential for the success of the global that they should be able to recognize store and present textual information like personal and organizational in the character used by those concerned that the must be able to handle national not found in the the same to the other global information on the network the data bases used in many information is especially problem as information are provided for on various difference hardware for the european at least different are in use on the network and for further information on these character we consider the other used in and the other the number of different set rise to as many as is the real and messy world we live in the character in this world is not an option as current run which can support only the character used by that system universal begun to appear experience with this solution been positive there are still many to be in the context of and the other character set which will exist on the in the future we agree on some common network model for character set handling general purpose tool be designed that will support both and regional character there solution that will make character set for plug and play an without the actual underlying implementation we use as common denominator for that it necessary to have document the language and the character which cater for particular language we need to solve these and is the only available general option today which is maybe close to be sufficient can we start with and make minimal or which will be sufficient for our needs we discuss the missing agreement in the communication such as the order of in the interchange of data is left to be by the sender and the recipient in are the sender and recipient on the we define mechanism to identify the order of data stream for the have been these have any merit amount of may be necessary for use in some do we need to specify that globally or we can leave it to particular region to be as regional matter we need to differentiate or specify how tagged data the field in data base and how order data are in communication protocol or will some common specification for the tag and the type be sufficient the goal of the is to test the interest for the various possible clear set of could be then will be defined received mon jun sent mon jun name chris merit subject id merit rare like to request that the for the be done so that it does not conflict

learned with much interest that people envision for international data exchange with point of view than usually in the sphere have been spending quite time of my life with such thought could contribute with small text explaining the way have finally come to think of the problem totally new probably but different shed of light maybe the text may sound theoretical at first is just terse the are based on experience have been put to use in the field of bit to the design of multinational bit support and the network work for is well on the way towards the the same theory that every character on the communication line is exception to this like directly to code on one machine is considered harmful to our even if convenient piece working towards common well defined goal finally more when all start to clutch than wandering for immediate interest hope that saying that my language is french will make the in difficult to write text even more convincing despite being short had for long the problem of common representation of computer specific data bit on the wire rather on the connection because different had different for them solve this problem like external data representation have been and because it was so important the have been adopted data little problem because was assumed full stop was hardly an expressed rule was tacit computer culture that its real dimension of an international mesh the problem of national usage becomes very real at least locally but more and more internationally computer to exchange more than generous people have spent much time to have system with character code translate data for system with code under protocol much respect for their work this is not no longer the way to do it that character exist on different the effort to to reach complete solution us count the different character have their share and the bill is amazing the most important point is that single common representation code be defined for the line suiting the purpose namely to cover all national in one single way and that people be instructed that every bit of text should travel in that code on the wire whatever the protocol is that common be available to translate present local code is best for computer to use the code of interchange internally but all in the world cannot be overnight computer to do to abide by the external representation is the sole matter of computer to appear to as if it were it internally any protocol the same way even during with computer ti the same code need not know which kind of system one is sending mail to no of the data nor any need to know any character code other than one own and the interchange code the order of magnitude to is the extended culture of some future no doubt is very important goal just now is fact that the choice of character code long lasting effects because of the building base the impact of today is by time the sooner the better the better the sooner theoretically said this time this local code to exchange code translation works much la layer or la if you don mind is towards lower layer and back to same level but possibly to different local code probably between level and as it could prove that the application layer all the textual data that not sure like for which can be used from many to convert data to line format we merge presentation and representation split level like level or not assign it to any level leave the discussion to the clear in my mind is that the translation is not in several final but protocol by itself like that other refer to this may be the most important point is pity to see each protocol tackle the problem its own way that the level or so concept applied to text slightly beyond the representation of and binary data towards file structure think of the line separator problem of for the basic case of text file structure file name is clearly specialized problem as opposed to communication of of text the impact on and design is just as high it will take much time to stand in doing otherwise would take even longer to erase and redo cannot increase complication eternally intermediate will have to be used like additional on some insist to not even try to convert to bit the rest of the to convert to bit instead and to rewrite all their to use complicated method for sending plain text when the sole problem is that it bit data the important thing is that the new layer be known and used the interest of both the writer and buyer will get void when system will use the interchange code for itself that the international character code is out it time for communication to be able to not only exchange and sound but also plain text will be used by for your interest go away for today you write anything you want me to read please

the document pub general the following statement which completely disagree with at least as stated here into other media such as speech is to communicate essentially mental picture of the dimensional form of an expression since almost all mathematics is conventionally expressed in dimensional graphical form most in that medium have no standard version in other media disagree in speech need to convey more than picture of the expression out listen to some of the demos on my site they make the point about spoken being independent of the visual layout far better than am capable of in plain text message that the contentious statement in our rationale document thought it sufficiently to have raman raman charleston adobe raman the expressed are my own and in no way should be taken as

will be every monday at until further notice dave will attempt to keep in the loop via on the list and separate phone further to the stu of his that they are too busy to accept the invitation at this time have the ralph for accepted the invitation to join the group along with couple of his the need for full whether it was necessary to use for the math notation we have preference for an extensible operator precedence notation can be included in and handled correctly by via the mechanism operator precedence there is need to constrain the context in which given can be used said this as simple as at first it might appear dave will work on formal mechanism for this is also unclear as to when macro is applied discussion on this is should be practical for to deal with missing sensibly in general on the context raman voiced concern on bruce comment on agreed however that fixed set of layout are sufficient for math raman to propose some new wording also gave us for his test suite which have added to the math home page ended by some of the for and number clear that bracket matching can in general be should be able to control the for this and for dave posted dump of his understanding as result of this conference call current dave march dave name sent us adobe subject for monday april us adobe raman math read the of the last few and dave proposal are some you want to have model for large or extendible would like to suggest that we consider again the model of and the modern barbara of the also done interesting work on math font layout in some or better automatic generation of from used in symbolic la label ref in or in is fraught with include piece wrote about that in relation to the the problem of symbolic never been one of the but one of finding an algorithm for printed from symbolic in the source document summary of the problem generic mechanism for some for presentation of is as type of object table figure equation reference its own counter top level start at the value zero at the beginning of the document is possible every level its own counter of below top level start at the value zero at the start tag of the next higher parent level the of the counter label is calculated label is printed in the article as it in journal issue the relation between and is application dependent sec id could be printed as the of the id are unique within the document instance the id attribute is not identical to the counter value the id attribute is missing the counter is not and the element is not for un that tables and always have an id attribute even when they are not are there also where tables and are not are at least the following to the algorithm above the contents of figure form one physical entity but inspection of the contents show that there are logical sub hidden inside the figure the contents of figure and which indicate logical sub and equation is interrupted by an equation number that is derived from an one in or sub in is interrupted list with is by paragraph of text the is on the same level as the and then the list the intention of the author to be em one list but this list is interrupted similar example can be found in equation sub and are by paragraph of text by and will discuss each case separately sub figure as far as we know hidden sub occur only with that as one physical entity of logical sub the only solution in this information which outside the document to the document possibility for this is to give the fig start tag new attribute that the of the individual generation of the of the sub an example of regular case fig id fig id file fig fig id file fig fig the outer figure and the two each have their own unique key for and we have the following id label where the counter and are as and but this presentation is application dependent of course an example of hidden sub fig id file fig the picture in two and that identify sub the figure as whole and the individual sub are we add an attribute to the start tag we can achieve this fig id the and are automatically these act as for since they refer to the same physical object the attribute also presentation we have the following id label where and refer to the same object physical figure in the document instance equation illustrate this case with an example an article the following sequence of that case we have the following id label for the first three the next equation should have an id label pair like this label where is the unique id assigned to equation and label for the label of the equation with id the next equation should have an id label pair like this the question is whether material to an label is the only form of derivation or whether other of derivation exist case with list within list or with sub look like special case of of list normally with but every list item must have an verb id that is unique within the document could be if we also the parent element verb we have li id footnote is li id should be paragraph of text comes between the two li id figure is li id table is and the author the list as agreed that one of the is to follow the author unless there are in the manuscript is intended to allow as well as rendering to graphical about rendering to paper are of in use in mathematics for those of you who think this is covered by modern and the although the latter are very useful should study of the following document pub is the documentation of our article and it tables with all and we use in typesetting our is redundancy in it know more important is that to cover this set you need more than the font is in discussion with several about the possibility of font set that all this and perhaps more and make it freely available will also solve legal with or of in think we should add something about vertical position of in mathematics and chemistry these differ as some of you may know the list of layout believe there is at least one missing namely an arrow that its width to the text above or below it is used in chemical and is different from an arrow or brace that its width to the text underneath it of both the brace is the ornament catalyst the text above the arrow is the ornament example lot of reserved occur from to of do you get these as normal in the text in about are we going to follow and most and use something like fraction numerator denominator or are we the horrible construct over been by people on the development team to express strong preference for the former and strong dislike for over it try to monitor the corner to our group on although the password dave gave me work dave can let me know several days in advance when telephone conference on monday can try to attend there will be on which am not at home from to midnight that noon to since we re in daylight saving time as of last weekend the the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth maybe some name ron math sent subject small regarding math longer piece about here have couple of smallish ask them in the

want to use the like notation because the and become too ron name raman adobe sent jun drizzle id us adobe subject on neil us adobe math did not see anything wrong in bruce description all was trying to do was to fill in the in the description as charleston adobe raman the expressed are my own and in no way should be taken as representative of my employer name dave sent jun id subject june math dave patrick robert raman left early ralph ron bruce neil the meeting bruce new proposal see pub dave about lexical for instance if one an character entity how does the know whether the character is as part of an identifier bruce that there needs to be large dictionary that such as the character is as the first or subsequent in an identifier it is an operator its prefix infix postfix and the associated left and right it can be used to embellish other bruce to add detailed schema for the character dictionary dave also that as matter of principle any tag should have meaningful bruce said he to avoid potential naming with other wishing to define new dave said that this big problem given role in dave to post proposal for the math tag robert added that to allow him to implement the proposal he would need more detail on the various layout schema bruce will work on this dave the flat with same for and neil that this it much easier to write the line breaking algorithm bruce will add an element to represent these the issue of and how plug in could exploit the parse tree the short term this will remain problem the representation for dave that the proposal from and pub setting position of array relative to preceding and column specification for cell alignment multiple or or as column separation of first row column as setting left and right bracket filling cell several with the for math make it inappropriate to use the table what might be appropriate within math the current inability to call the browser to handle such we need to take cautious approach the minimum we probably need plain text simple of emphasis bold control over font size links line could further allow this text to include math so that we get math text math seem to be in practice though the current plug in are inadequate for instance one would like to know the current font family size and position as well as the background color or texture tile and pattern origin would like to set the visible size according to the expression being displayed and to be sent message when relevant are can based style influence the style used within dave would like the math to put pressure on browser to fix these neil to investigate plug in to see what have been made to the short term solution would be to add to the math to specify the context in which the occur or the control panel for the math plug in would allow the user to set the font size to be used in these for folding and unfolding idea is to allow the author to name and then to use that name in place of further of that folded the given name would be shown in place of the itself the scope for such be to single math element could be via and bruce through the case where for are automatically at browse time require any special markup although the ability to give the same name to common will depend on the ability to recognize that these are in fact semantically identical previous discussion raman pointed out that it would be helpful if the user is to set the name of as this it easier to remember important for speech base dave name neil sent mon jun id drizzle subject on adobe math first reading it that the step of needs to happen before the operator precedence step this will allow us to handle complex as to other complex correctly which works in manner similar to what bruce no problem handling complex as in your example am too with the algorithm and that filled in missing in bruce description but see anything wrong with his description you have simple example in mind where it neil name raman adobe sent jun id us adobe subject june dave math the naming of like to point out two slightly of expression naming relevant to speech you could name cross object such as an equation with meaningful formula instead of equation this made listening to cross material easier current thesis also the other kind of sub expression naming which think got yesterday during the meeting to this in as variable substitution folding to use dave terminology also fairly straight forward naming algorithm for giving meaningful to sub lower constraint and denominator the problem of that two are identical is actually very hard if you re working with written typeset document did not attempt to do this even without the intelligence to recognize two semantically equivalent of variable substitution or folding as dave to it in his is really useful for speech and suspect it would be very useful for small visual fact after the variable substitution in rich at pointed out that symbolic math in the early had to implement something analogous to display complex since the available at the time were not as graphically rich as what we have today are the relevant from the thesis current thesis and current thesis charleston adobe raman the expressed are my own and in no way should be taken as representative of my employer name dave sent jun id subject on math drizzle which works in manner similar to what bruce no problem handling complex can see value in prefix and postfix to act as operator for instance to add to or to change their relative size or position these embellishment prefix and postfix have high precedence and hence bind tightly to the adjacent operator then don see any missing something dave name sent jun id version subject more on proposal math read the proposal from again more agree with ron and should have said so before that the effort that gone into this proposal is substantial and this is really concrete stuff we can chew on also had the feeling for some time and the same feeling in the community that the of and of in general were suffering from syndrome also see that extensible are hard to realize within the of the language certainly support the use of entity for mathematical and technical as have written reading the discussion between bruce and ron have come to the conclusion that the plug in solution will not work because we need the possibility of anchor within math and math in text in math like to see what you all think about this since this is what dave at the meeting in illinois the the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth maybe some name ron math sent jun id subject more on proposal math recently also had the feeling for some time and the same feeling in the community that the of and of in general were suffering from syndrome understand such think it wise for this committee to keep good citizenship in mind and agree that we should be receptive to reaction and criticism from elsewhere own of this committee work to date follow the immediate goal of an capability might have been to simply render math visually and perhaps this was the goal of that goal been considerably expanded as we look at now as the work of the stopped short of ways to handle semantic of math markup that the were many and difficult the work of this committee in that regard to me welcome addition to the overall discussion of those of as the semantics of any formal discipline rather closer to form than many acknowledge also welcome this committee to examine more primitive notational base for the standard effort in some sense with roy very healthy to me undissuadable in my view the proposal certainly the need to accommodate and and style of markup my recent list of and to bruce made reference to the fact that felt gave good basis for the fundamental layout schemata and might better be used than for math was and still do that formal support such as this would give direct of filtering math into math in this way strong to prior work then there may be the feeling that is pushing standard of its own stephen himself at very powerful wattage found the committee from quite accommodating and undogmatic view their as wholly positive certain that was not otherwise but would communicate this to from outside the committee if perception of centric standard is is quiet statement not defensive one ron name sent jun id version subject to ron math ron undogmatic view their as wholly positive certain that was not otherwise but would ron is right was not trying to assert otherwise but was question perhaps not neutrally enough because am only vaguely familiar with the question because to know how feasible the are that bruce already something similar this is an argument in support of feasibility also might give an indication of how easy or difficult it is to come up with real implementation agree with ron that there is some politics involved as well think this group should make it absolutely clear that we will draw inspiration from as much as we need and that we will use the entity and also that is not running the show as an aside at the conference roy the meeting of the committee responsible for by eric van and we got him to consent to the idea that there will always be who need insist on geometric visual notation said he but should have said he grudgingly and certainly not wholeheartedly the the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth maybe some name dave sent jun id subject more on proposal math reading the discussion between bruce and ron have come to the conclusion that the plug in solution will not work because we need the possibility of anchor within math and math in text in math like to see what you all think about this since this is what dave at the meeting in illinois agree that today plug in are inadequate and am working to get this fixed can however make within work the is mouse and can in turn call back to the browser to display is enough to allow anchor within math and math in text in math with the burden on the dave name neil sent jun id drizzle subject on math which works in manner similar to what bruce no problem handling complex can see value in prefix and postfix to act as operator for instance to add to or to change their relative size or position these embellishment prefix and postfix have high precedence and hence bind tightly to the adjacent operator then don see any missing something think that there is problem with prefix the are technical so people who don care can stop reading the parser something like it by the time of reading the that it must have right operand the most reasonable error correction would be to have the consider the following bold with bold being high precedence prefix operator the parser the it that it must be prefix operator and so will shift the on this expression would result in bold get what you probably you would need to write bold for large number of such as bold the right thing would happen is just when you try to embellish an

prefix embellishment operator this big this would parse as big where is an infix operator presumably multiplication consider the following bold with bold being high precedence prefix operator the parser the it that it must be prefix operator and so will shift the on this expression would result in bold each operator property that it can act as an embellishment on other then we can use this fact to make the above parse as bold in preference to the interpretation of bold as normal prefix operator essence we sort the operator precedence reduction into sequence that potential between different operator defined by the dictionary for each symbol have already that people are comfortable with dictionary for the of as prefix infix or postfix their the dictionary to define whether each

letter to david author of for columbine or probably the most comprehensive among many of the oscar winning documentary have now gone so far as to call for the revocation of the award are small however as their rely on polemic exaggeration and misrepresentation in other on the same which they accuse moore of david is fascinating to watch the organized character assassination of michael moore that been going on in the since the release of his last documentary time of simple minded patriotism loud clear and dissenting like mr moore are as disturbing and have to be silenced partially through well funded public partially through conservative grass propaganda surprisingly much of the criticism of moore film is misguided or outright wrong often vastly more inaccurate than moore work itself moore the as an unethical dishonest organization he the paranoia and fear in the as primary cause of violence and he does not see gun ownership itself as problem documentary is full of subtle humor jaw dropping dialogue and dark in all it is an accurate portrayal of america gun and violence culture also about america foreign policy of recent which have been all but by moore your you state that moore resolution is questionable all early in the movie he the possibility that violent video and watching violent can cause violence because like and japanese positively love those violent and violent cannot cause violence then how can about violence do so is faulty generalization as moore although never as fact video and violent are relatively harmless it does not logically follow that all of media presentation are harmless is huge difference for example between game like and listening to radio broadcast that you that your family will be unless you take action to kill now the latter is the kind of media propaganda that was used to unleash genocide in in which people the main motivation for the beyond the promise of wealth was that were supposedly being and had to be saved media propaganda can incite people to kill fiction like video on the other hand violence in narrative context which may very well desensitize to said violence but no causative link ever been proven moore hypothesis which apparently comes at least in part from the book of by barry also on moore is that the constant bombardment with of fear can incite paranoia which itself can lead to violent is consistent with the kind of media violence above and in no relationship whatsoever to the theory of video game or music violence is no surprise however that and european media do not question their own propaganda of fear moore second hypothesis is that america foreign policy may contribute to the belief that violence is an appropriate to solve hypothesis which is by many and who grow up in war torn are known for similar war is as normal part of existence violence as natural way to solve sense the same message is to american who grow up being told that it is not acceptable to be violent to one another but who simultaneously have to endure corporal punishment and media about how the of freedom are moore film was made before the dead of and were on national were gloating over this demented corpse show like little too so you have to make do with for their last goes for your grandson too by the way think with the was good idea sammy was when he was cheer the killing of yet wonder why their own grow up to be more violent than those in other is paradoxical like this one which moore film to address list number of in moore is true that moore film is sometimes unintentionally deceptive but to call it fraudulent is hyperbole to the extreme is no more so than any other successful documentary of the last look at some specific the bank scene listed on your on separate page have stated that this scene was staged but in the bank interview the official moore that the bank its own vault about at any given time is also licensed dealer which can perform its own background an interview with the linked from your site an employee that the gun would have been normally picked up at another dealer is not what normally is supposed to mean but that claim flatly the statement of the bank official in the film more like later correction for public but of course nobody the bank when they can be used against moore the only thing that moore compressed is the to the same interview you re looking at week to days waiting period is plausible but entirely irrelevant for the movie which already it quite clear that background check is being moore have sometimes extended those days to several the bank own estimate is nothing inaccurate whatsoever about the bank scene the bank does exactly what it out from its vault to those who open an account the silly of the scene obscure the real obscenity of the situation bank out to its the utter laxness of how deal with deadly and love of that on the religious the martin interview is perhaps the criticism repeated the most often and it also the most inaccurate the actual from the film are often incorrectly the dialogue goes as moore you don think our say to themselves gee dad goes off to the factory every day he are of mass destruction the difference between that mass destruction and the mass destruction over at columbine school person guess don see that specific connection because the that you re talking about were built and designed to defend us from somebody else who would be against us note the word our in moore question moore is not from colorado his question is generic not meant to refer specifically to the martin plant in question it this way otherwise he would protest against the plant being of moore have cleverly response and moore as spreading about the plant did not believe the public to be that gullible response to one moore detractor wrote other of martin elsewhere in the country produce to support the defense of the we make no at the area facility moore course have conveniently the fact that martin does supply of mass destruction to the military and that the company is the nation military contractor as moore correctly out it is bizarre for society to openly embrace the production of destructive but on the other hand see no connection of this to everyday violence learn by moore this point through slight exaggeration by moving with the camera through the plant but he no incorrect statement is typical for his to jump on what is at most slightly misleading implication but in doing so they themselves have unlike moore made many incorrect meeting like yourself claim that moore massively distorted evidence to support his point that effectively the of the columbine tragedy by holding rally in shortly afterwards the from my cold dead part is used by moore as visual citation to introduce is perhaps one of his most famous shown on national even here in this is the person we are talking about does moore say or imply that these were at the rally in and in fact their later in the movie at another occasion oddly by to be again is simply reminder of this is moore way to say meet gun nut the visual of billboard and narration is by you as evidence that moore is trying to somehow tie the two together when in reality it is quite obvious that he does it to separate the introduction of from his speech in moore is professional he on maximum impact of each of the he and to accomplish that effect subtle instead of long winded is common technique but because conservative are not familiar with the of they believe who claim that he is the interview he does is standard practice the same goes for the interview which moore would expect us to have him quote in his entirety have him present fully the that the used to justify its rally in for of balance the was fully aware of the scandal it would cause through its rally and decided to push on because they to have enough media support to successfully do so were right claim that there was no way to change location since you have to give advance notice of that to the and there were upwards of days are more than enough to give advance warning of change in location or date had the really to is probably correct that their primary reason for not doing so was to save money not to piss off the of does not change the fact that they did just that moore the most important part of the speech to back up this point and the fluff is what good documentary is about here the again ignore important evidence the mayor of the crowd loudly up hand to read the mayor letter only to explain in detail why he chose to ignore the request not at all the you have given by the crowd not with single word in your transcript or your article that the crowd was fully aware of the controversy they would cause by coming to after were being there and they effectively said you say that they could not have done otherwise is bold lie by moore the case like yourself charge moore with deception the rally took place on october the shooting on february standard are as smooth distortion moore works by you of context and your mind to fill the vacuum with completely false is brilliantly if unethically done as noted above the from my cold dead part is simply moore way to introduce anyone but moore view it as anything else certainly does not attribute it to speech where it was not and as noted above doing so twice would make no sense whatsoever if moore was the mastermind deceiver that his claim he is the hoya interview where was about you write is no indication that case is naive to the extreme would not be president of the if he was not kept up to date on the most prominent of gun violence if he did not respond to that part of the interview he certainly knew about the case at that point the excerpt about the case and the of the phrase after is pronounced dead is one valid criticism but far from the deliberate distortion you make it out to be rather it is an example for how the can sometimes be easy to miss with moore fast pace the reason the sentence is is not to deceive the viewer into believing that hurried to to immediately hold rally there as will become quite obvious but simply to highlight the first mention of the name in the text which is in this paragraph because the is rather fast it is easy to miss the rest of the sentence so as you correctly note some got an incorrect impression would have been fair for moore to point out this possible misinterpretation on his the claim of deliberate distortion is ludicrous for several moore clearly that before he came to gave an interview the excerpt from said interview we can see that it is from march moore to deceive his why would he say this and show the month the interview was should moore leave the clinton is on the visible in the text which is necessary to correctly interpret the part the sequence several times and it is perfectly possible to see this text without the soccer interview and the showing the rally make no effort to distort the fact that this rally after the fact the camera on cheney and the protestor is as saying that we to let the know that we haven forgotten about make the hysterical claim that the interview may be on the basis that no name is shown for the interviewee but if moore had it why the hell should he put this sentence in the protestor mouth which directly the conclusion that the rally after death did moore the masterful not edit this sequence out no sense may vary on how tasteless it was for to hold pro gun rally on the location of the nation school shooting after the fact but this sequence of is without doubt the most unfair to the of deliberate distortion don hold up when the whole scene though as one should never attribute to malice what can be to incompetence the somewhat inept of the press release led some to wrong which is unfortunate but moore have no interest in the matter fairly they done so moore himself would probably have for the gaffe any case at no point does moore make false statement in contradiction to by that his documentary is full of write the desired impression moore with his interview no he accuse moore so often of the chronology yet you have no it yourself the interview is at the very end of the movie the rally comes brief interview with where he is about again clear evidence that the local media in raised about the presence then an with country prosecutor arthur entirely by of the film who also presence as notable and to the immediate of people from all over america gun who according to him aggressively to of accessible to much like spanking react aggressively when anti point to case of child being or severely injured by beating people do not feel the need to express sympathy or to think about ways to avoid such but they feel the need to assert their and to look for quick simple as gun to the child from the highest tree is all not by of moore movie who claim to be objective the best example of the paranoia surrounding moore film is your sub essay the end of the interview itself moore simple question how could the scene have been with simple answer two this you construct an obscure conspiracy of re enactment for all we can tell moore could have to make turn around and then silent as left if your re enactment theory is true and see no evidence that you have actually tried to ask the people involved in the for their opinion this itself is not unethical and you have no evidence whatsoever that moore done anything unethical here just like you have no evidence that moore unethically removed of the interview use standard technique as basis to construct bizarre which sound plausible to the gullible reader without ever providing any evidence for the implicit or explicit of fraud and distortion history of the course the cartoon is highly and most consider it one of the of the film it valid claim which you ignore entirely the strategy to promote gun for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was way to uphold racism without an openly terrorist organization like the flourish the century in the southern promote gun for black people highly doubt it if they one of their was to continue the racism of the is the key message of this part of the animation which is again being by its shooting in write the little boy was the class thug already suspended from school for stabbing another with pencil and had fought with the day before characterization of six year old as pencil stabbing thug is exactly the kind of hysteria that moore film against is the typical right wing reaction which for simple that do not contradict the the was little bastard and the were involved in case closed why do people deal with it so much fun to do so is by now well that the crack in to fund the operation of south american is equally well known that the so war on begun under the administration is failure which cost of and made america the world leader in prison population both in relative and absolute poor the highly profitable drug business obviously is often seen as the last resort the real cause here are not the themselves but poverty and the war on the boy mother not been shipped to welfare to work program she might at least have had some time to spend with her son every child psychologist that mother child bonding is essential for the development of empathy and social the awareness of the of one and the learning of conflict resolution by non violent the official by moore the welfare to work program knowing full well that the drug issue is red herring again your emphasis on the little boy as thug moore and assertion that people to the child from the highest tree instead of looking at the real because while there is so war on there is no war on poverty is frequently as natural and the poor in america are seen by as who are just too lazy to work reality what moore here is the most vivid example of what can only be wage slavery have ever seen to the detriment of is notable that the reaction to this segment of the film was even more dismissive than yours moore claim preposterous could he even think about blaming poverty and forced labor for anything bad that and american aid the september it was necessary for to somehow explain away the fact that the government gave million to the new mind the fact that such as robert of the as early as in may mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motivation but because of the violent enforcement of the ban on opium mind that in regime that is by it does not matter who is authorized to distribute the aid the ruling regional will seize control of it and use it to their own advantage mind that this very argument been used by in opposition to sending humanitarian aid to iraq mind that the continued selling opium in spite of the deal mind that this is all on michael moore about the film are moore point and it is surprising that his don dwell on them longer because they know all too well that moore is correct the have far greater homicide rate both gun and non gun than most other first world main mistake is that he does not use population corrected data his second mistake is that he does not cite his and as you correctly point out he probably different for the different good comparison of international homicide can be found on the relatively neutral surprisingly too data from different as know from personal experience it is quite difficult to do of crime statistics due to in frequency and methodology the gun homicide for the moore according to are japan per per per australia per per fail to credit moore with not making the same mistake that some gun control make concluding that gun ownership to violence fact moore several counter and more such counter can indeed be is intuitively obvious that do not actually cause violence but it is equally intuitively obvious that they make the violence that is more deadly is the second intuition which gun like the seek to obscure fraudulent data by the of john mary the gun control movement on the other hand from the real of violence poverty paranoia the war on and these were gun ownership in the would not be problem but also unnecessary just like it is in canada ammunition purchase write moore casually ammunition at an us to look at what foreign citizen was able to do at local canadian mart several of ammunition without question being raised right could buy as much ammunition as in canada canadian have pointed out that the buy is or illegal again you fail to distinguish between regular film and word which canadian have never used for such distortion moore would have been boiled alive by his moore simply chose not to show how he revealed his identification to the salesperson there is nothing fraudulent about that made no whatsoever in the film about the need to show or not show identification claim that it is possible to purchase ammunition in is independent from that claim allegedly racism conclude from own that was somehow as racist anything it is his own failure that he did not clarify what he meant with more mixed in the interview were evasive and unhelpful this can in part be with his age and mental condition if he is unable to defend the of the he should not be their spokesman this case can be applied to he is probably not racist but incompetent of inappropriate cutting are once again entirely unsupported in fact it is quite clear from watching that particular scene that there is not single cut from the point at which moore second time for the cause of the higher violence in the and the point when he the incident himself look like fool that should hardly be blamed on michael moore write for columbine is dishonest is fraudulent trash it even the audio video editor to assemble speech that did not give and and carefully text to spin the viewer mind to wrong conclusion of this is true is true is that for columbine is diamond in the small world of big screen one that brightly and an often misunderstood aspect of american culture is not flawless diamond the scene in particular from bad the statistics are suboptimal and bit more than he than towards the the movie hard to avoid simplistic and comes up with some thoughtful the most shameful part of the ongoing against moore is that these have been all but by his moore to make propaganda film he would have used other material from america moore is one of the most talented in the today and his film fully deserved its oscar the shrill and remarkably unsuccessful campaign to revoke his award to be more by jealousy than by real about the film accuracy is not only the highest non music documentary of all time among the of the film it is also the highest rated one to the the documentary genre huge debt to michael moore after success like and the were taken seriously and shown in many more than otherwise likely perhaps the campaign against moore is really by another reason next project the working title fahrenheit the temperature at which freedom and he to launch it shortly before the next presidential election is unlikely however that the unfair against him will have much of an impact all the same kind of blitz was against the previous record holding documentary roger by michael moore sincerely erik text is in the public domain for red and fiction have been humanoid that could pass for as of yet no robot to fool human for more than few and no robot been that can integrate itself into human society insect however is much simpler research been done on the of social such as and and in fact have undetected

and rain the forage for more than different of many of which do not grow in the desert gordon where only few of small small herbaceous flowering and short do grow gordon and other species of are present in the desert but red harvester seem to be relatively undisturbed by these gordon sometimes do break out with other red harvester from different tend not to be aggressive gordon of this will ignore other ant species in the design of and will not create fighting behavior will be to navigate in this environment and will be designed to find in sandy soil the the of this species are of two breeding and and sterile female and will not be considered in this proposal as their and design is much more specialized and would be applicable only during the breeding season which but once per year the of the sterile may be divided into several brood care nest maintenance and is known about brood care as this only in the of the nest and observation would generally require the destruction of the nest maintenance and seed are likewise difficult to observe in the of the nest but the and deposition of waste dirt and nest garbage outside of the nest midden work close enough to the surface to be observable and too occur for the most part outside of the nest and have therefore been studied extensively ex al gordon al gordon gordon is therefore these three that would like to focus on in this proposal the remain bit too mysterious to yet model and the ability of robot to pass undetected in the of colony would be very difficult to observe three each present different to the ant and to the modeler though there is some overlap particularly with navigational the case of midden work must be able to identify garbage grasp it carry it out of the nest and deposit it about halfway down the mound before to repeat the process ad or until to switch may be divided into two distinct sub nest and trail ant engaged in nest must exit the nest at the proper time in the morning and wander about for bit on the nest mound presumably taking of the temperature and humidity in some way and making sure that it is safe for the other to exit the level of degradation of the nest cuticular after this short foray into the sun and heat as an indication of the outside to the who may then upon smelling the patroller be either to forage or to remain inactive inside the nest ant engaged in trail must exit the nest wander around searching for food identify food upon discovery and return to the nest to show the where the food is is thought to be accomplished by the deposition of chemical from gland on the abdomen that the patroller along the ground on her return route to the nest that the may then follow gordon al as in addition to following these to the food must also be able to identify food grasp it and carry it back to the nest engaged in all three must be able to identify other and their current as well as indicate to other their own status and current task walk navigate both within and outside of the nest and of course switch at appropriate times the will be on tiny system will be in for which some is included will include thermometer bump polarization compass and series of

tongs will also feature skirt of bump sonar and chemical of extracted from of the nest being and for successful and will be at filling station each morning as that they are getting will likewise recharge at special station at night just inside the nest entrance for the of this proposal will assume that enough battery life to remain powered the whole day rudimentary blueprint of is attached order to inform itself about its environment will need number of an attempt to mimic the red harvester ant as closely as possible these include thermometer bump and sonar polarization compass and series of chemical on pair of corresponding to the antennae its front will have tactile skin to sense pressure the of the rest of these will depend on their function the thermometer will be on the rear of the robot to keep it out of the way and will detect and input to the robot the outside temperature in celsius do not exit the nest when the outside temperature is above celsius gordon and the ability to use temperature gradient will enable in nest navigation will also be with one photoreceptor in the middle of the top of its chassis corresponding to the will be useful for behavior in the morning and shutting off at night the first poke their out of the nest shortly after sunrise and scuttle back in at night gordon the bump and sonar will form skirt around to keep it from with other the sonar will constantly be nearby and initiate an escape maneuver when their pass certain threshold of stimulation and the bump will when depressed also initiate the escape function the sonar will correspond to the limited optical object detection ability and the bump will allow the robot to detect the polarization compass will consist of two light at and from the center front of respectively that will orient towards desired polarization pattern would correspond to the in the sensitive to light and research shown that many do navigate path integration system input from polarization compasses and from sort of odometer al would use system for the input from its polarization compass based on the compass designed by and in of two with blue and the difference of their would be returned to who will use simultaneous model to navigate to the nest each exit from the nest will take single scan of the sky and will orient itself according to an analytical procedure to derive compass information from different polarization later should be sufficient to return to the nest given the accuracy by al and the relatively short of time that harvester spend outside the nest before of the polarization opponent unit by al the unit in polarization through the two polarization sensitive and them into the logarithm ratio amplifier which the difference of the from the the vector heading returned from the two polarization sensitive function themselves rely primarily on chemical information taken in through their antennae and to mimic this will have chemical and with which to both interact with other who may be to find an ant without antennae and take in chemical information will need to have to measure the alkene present in another cuticular which research is the marker for harvester of current task perhaps because the are in the dry sun causing different ratio of to and the presence of branched in the hydrocarbon profile al as in gordon would also have for the themselves which research indicate to the whether another ant is their arnold al as in gordon to detect food and for three of those by successful with food those by successful to the nest and those marking piles of trash as midden that successful to the nest do have different effect on the inactive than unsuccessful al successful have an even greater effect on activity will not leave the nest unless patroller gordon and the rate of in colony can be by rolling glass coated with cuticular extracted from into the nest gordon gordon to be marked in some olfactory way since removing midden from them more likely to be by other species gordon for the of this proposal will assume that the nest maintenance and food have marked the midden with particular of these chemical will be in an array on pair of chemical with four of each type of receptor per stalk technique by al been shown to improve the chemical plume of the will lead back down through the stalk to the on board will have tactile on

and turning mechanism to determine the orientation towards nest and the distance from the nest when outside in nest navigation an escape function for when are or into object identification and gripping generic algorithm for plume and chemical trail following and the identification of other for simple start the forward cruise function will merely take in double integer speed and cause to move forward at this speed cruise in number the desired speed robot to cruise forward at said speed assumed to be on scale being void double speed wheel input the appropriate speed is double calibration to zero and as necessary the robot will receive the command as long as this function is running left motor speed calibrate right motor speed end similar rotate function will be used to orient towards particular heading in desired angle to rotate the robot and accordingly that is sufficient to rotate the robot completely around one wheel this may be in implementation void rotate

appropriate portion of else while timer angle left motor right motor end while end else end rotate will often be used in other running on schema basis and when combined with the forward cruise function should cause the robot to move at an angle order to orient itself toward the nest while outside will need to determine which direction the nest is in and rotate toward that heading and also how far from the nest it is at its current location the orientation and distance should be calculable by the polarization pattern according to the system set up by al will therefore have polarization function that will return compass direction toward which it should orient in order to return home to the nest and distance function that will return the direct distance may assume that this first function will return direction in positive or negative and that the second function will return distance in the first function might look something like this in the polarization sensitive photo diode

inside the nest and older work more outside the nest as result will model the three main in the order that they are to be engaged in work which of moving dirt between the inside of the nest and the outside will occur first which shorter overall amount of time spent outside will occur second and will be the final behavior will discuss main method the task switching between these the midden work behavior will be default initial behavior will be in the morning by the sunrise and will continue until the outside temperature at which point all red harvester must return to the nest as previously stated midden worker must identify midden grasp it and carry it to the surface it halfway down the mound before to collect more midden program this behavior might look like this will leave nest in the morning after sunrise carrying of midden halfway down the nest mound and them will return to the nest and repeat this task until the temperature above celsius void midden by sunrise stopped by temperature while photo sunrise temp midden and identify any found they are midden grip and carry outside nest if midden detect grip cruise to halfway down the nest mound while release reset midden detect midden detect end if end while end midden the second behavior two sub nest and trail will involve leaving the nest roaming around on the nest mound for few and the nest behavior will be in two with task switching algorithm based on age that do change their based partly on their life expectancy al and that task switching is partly genetically by switch in gene expression as the individual ingram al is therefore reasonable to assign constant age at which will switch from nest to trail order to perform both of these will need to explore in zig zag fashion as harvester do gordon display preference to wander in familiar territory though and do sometimes wander into other gordon control for this behavior explore will display preference for exploration in where there is low gradient of model is reasonable because and change their territory from day to day even though they do retain some more commonly chosen gordon the code may look something like this in desired distance from nest

initial default behavior will not address task switching to midden work probably switch to based on their life expectancy and as function of gene whose expression between young and old and this is easily clock pulse counter in that will count its age since last boot remind the reader this technique was in this proposal to create the limited task switching between nest and trail the switch from

easily noted is language the command of language while not access to the community which it is often the key to gaining entry turn communal identity can be formed around language it is used as the focal point around which the group when considering the indigenous revitalization which in century latin america the impact of those indigenous on those and the nature of the identity of the

indigenous in latin america particular will examine two divergent yet remarkably parallel that of the maya in and the and of struggle to attain status in still bearing the of spanish colonialism is deeply tied to their struggle to reaffirm the nature of their indigenous identity and is in turn linked to the interaction of spanish and their native the effects of spanish colonialism are both far reaching and deeply in both of the most prominent lasting is that of the land grant system the spanish government to instate the encomienda system in which conquistador direct control over the indigenous and their land was in turn by the the were to maintain control over their land and their but in every way the inferior of the spanish providing labor and as reality land ownership were the exclusive right of the spanish resulting in modern day malappropriation of land ownership in the of the of the spanish warren are commonly or migrant the plight of the native was first by the marxist of the early century those were the first to articulate the necessity of the independent identity of the indigenous previously both the left and right belief in indigenous assimilation into the dominant spanish culture the on the contrary that the indigenous possessed unique identity they also that they were part of group the working class whose poverty was direct result of american imperialism therefore they should join these new popular leftist in order to reorganize society into worker friendly one jackson this in civil war between the and and party truce established between the and to meet the of the who in turn sustained guerrilla in response warfare since become part of colombian life multiple maintain an ongoing presence often themselves in the remote mountainous often by various indigenous is similar to the situation of the government felt it to battle communism an armed and dangerous menace within plunging the country into civil warfare in the and through the warren in persecution against the who make up about of the overall population both were often associated with the native in many there were but in the merely used the remote inaccessible as over were were and over million more were the main guerrilla force was in with the establishment of peace accord warren the growth in popularity and militarism of these popular leftist is with the development of the indigenous revitalization the the need to assert cause separate from the general left was seen and indigenous formed warren jackson to these was the question of indigenous identity largely lost amidst the overwhelming spanish influence local sought to rediscover their native and redefine what it meant to be part of indigenous culture pan in particular sought to organize itself around the mayan language despite local dialectical it is seen as the force behind the diverse mayan people still speak it in various and by mayan to standardize the language are coherent modern version of maya pan in part due to its focus on of it largely specifically political instead on the development of the mayan culture the popular left however to see the rhetoric of ethnic as politically viable tool therefore often the banner of indigenous in its own discourse the pan mayan movement thus from the lasting influence of the popular left on guatemalan governmental without drawing the often negative attention of the government warren main concern among pan is the reversal of the long seated inferiority complex of the mayan people despite their position as majority within the guatemalan population they remain and on the of society in part from the ingrained of spanish colonialism spanish to be associated with modernity and social mobility whereas maya is seen as backward and inferior pan mayan therefore seek to develop return to maya as it was in its classical renaissance language of power and prestige doing so they hope to inculcate among the mayan sense of pride which will in turn reverse the dogma of spanish superiority in contrast no unified pan indian the indigenous population is small fraction of the overall population entity divided by region and language and oftentimes conflicting indigenous advocacy have the itself as the sole pan indian group yet legitimacy in the of many indigenous jackson the which on language development and renewal is primarily representative of the jackson often in conflict with the its counterpart jackson the benefit from single main identity those of must operate under historical between the various ethnic jackson the and have stood in opposition since colonial times therefore any coalition between the two advocacy is tenuous at best desire among the themselves to maintain distinct ethnic both from the spanish colombian population and each other the the rhetoric of cultural diversity was picked up the colombian media and subsequently the consciousness of the greater metropolitan public thereby its place in colombian society as necessity and further the role of indigenous in gaining for indigenous as whole major success in the colombian saga is the constitution of which section on indigenous as the which it included from native and is return to the old land grant system stemming from the of the colonial era along with judicial sovereignty the was originally used to repress the indigenous it is now used to support them or communally of land are to are by the local governing formed of community and the return to customary law substantial shift in indigenous identity no longer by and discourse are forced to assess the efficacy of their old judicial in light of the modern era the oral nature of jurisprudence directly with the desire of the colombian government to codify law and of human are common as are often corporal in nature and the colombian constitution in stark contrast to the failure of the guatemalan indigenous referendum of formal recognition in as the majority population in precursor to the peace accord by its government referendum on an indigenous bill of that in the colombian constitution warren despite the mayan majority possible include the overwhelming illiteracy among the indigenous population and inaccessibility of voting warren it on greater level both the desire of many to assimilate as they still feel that is necessary for social mobility and belief among the general population that do not require separate bill of as they are covered under the general already in the constitution warren are in fact correlated with the mayan language itself those who speak spanish are more likely to be literate than those who speak mayan alone in the legislature the law of national which while spanish as the official language the importance of indigenous as part of national identity and their active promotion largely symbolic it is still significant in that guatemalan identity is seen as other than spanish question of identity as defined by language differently in and the pan mayan movement there remains desire to maintain linguistic diversity some view the reduction of their language to the status of dialect their unique identity and place in the mayan world however despite over standardization the pan mayan movement itself is largely cohesive contrast colombian indigenous are divided to the extent that linguistic diversity is not only valued but to split the population both between and within themselves example is the while considered single ethnic group they maintain distinct language and practice linguistic exogamy in which of one language group must marry into another jackson further works to establish identity by markedly removed from that of the dominant culture cosmology or is difficult to translate into it concept of culture defined as the form of behavior resulting from permanent harmonic relationship with and and view of history as cyclic that is often at odds with of thought between arise as is and often by native in tandem with indigenous by outside and non governmental the between and native then lead to conflict within the revitalization themselves the question of embracing law and discourse is continually with is necessary to work within the national legal system in order to gain policy reform beyond the local level however with widely of justice balance is difficult to achieve law in with law as it different perception of casual tying back to the indigenous concept of harmony are as in the community harmony and can often be back to those who did not perpetuate the crime but may have the accused to do so punishment often public and corporal in nature is carried out the group the effects as whole often sit with the criminal as he his sentence in their ordeal are the criminal is seen as his duty to restore harmonic order and is back into the community and of law into native proved to be difficult task as often have no parallel in indigenous the translation of the colombian constitution sparked the development of as the goal of the was not to provide direct translation of the constitution but to recapture its spirit in native rather than discourse and second interpretation of law distinct from that of the spanish colombian culture and in turn an interpretation with native ideology for the to follow when governing another vital role as it is employed in the rediscovery of the indigenous identity itself and advocacy regularly work to translate native back into native of knowledge them from the that have over the past six the history project native history as the outward which are both cyclic and parallel in nature mayan translate and document oral whose legacy is in danger of being forgotten attempt to regain identity via translation is indicative of the intimate relationship between indigenous revitalization within modern context and native language use arise however as between the traditional and modern and native and spanish develop native in are monolingual spanish raising the question of the practicality of indigenous language use the between in spanish and indigenous are great leading to the difficulty of governing in spanish yet embracing indigenous mode of thought addition there complex relationship between what are as different of indigenous identity the for example divide themselves into the traditional modern and new the authenticity of the modern who are often metropolitan spanish to reconnect with their is brought into question by the traditional who speak and lead rural existence the fact remains that spanish is the gateway to social mobility of conflict and refugee status have established the desire to leave rural way of life for an urban one and those literate in spanish have the to do so and poverty is associated with maya thus there is the conflict between the desire to recapture the unique mayan identity via the language and the need to improve living which most often under spanish influence further complication is the necessity of authentic both in the of fellow indigenous and the outside spanish culture the of legitimacy precisely because it is as not indian enough it the use of spanish and discourse leading to distrust among indigenous jackson make point of in their native dress and speaking in their native language in assembly even if they are more at home in business suit and speaking spanish indigenous identity become calling card to the extent that at times it to be caricature of itself the colombian constitution is problematic in that it little guide as to what exactly an indigenous group the concept of culture is so complex and divergent that self determination in the of the colombian government towards development then cannot endanger traditional culture and for fear of losing cultural legitimacy jackson duality in native culture for example many receive instruction in yet converse in spanish outside the classroom emphasis on rather than native culture indigenous authenticity is by sustaining knowledge of traditional and without fully embracing them on day to day basis and intersection of language and indigenous identity which have yet to be fully they are largely comprised of the conflict between poverty and progress the pan mayan movement must meet the dual of positive identity within the mayan population itself and legitimacy in the legal and political in order to gain policy and in law legal have often come about due to the colombian government recognition of the political viability of the rhetoric of indigenous by indigenous judicial sovereignty they hope to win the trust of people who view the government as incapable of protecting them from the ongoing civil strife and by giving them of land they hope that the indigenous community will be able to keep out drug and where the government itself not jackson of the ulterior behind their legal status indigenous in now possess the to teach and govern in their own according

although it is often difficult to call completely tonal never entirely itself of tonal and structure remains true even with one of his last the for written two before his death in the discussion that the first movement of the on the tonal at play throughout the movement the analysis will treat the movement tonally investigating the progression of local and its relationship to the overall form will also examine to what degree tonal reading of this movement is limited in its analytical potential in an attempt to pinpoint exactly where from common practice compositional and the form of the first movement as more or less regular sonata form that does not seem to be meaningful assertion it is perfectly accurate the movement is in sonata form but there is an introduction that does not relate thematically to any other of the movement not unheard of in and the recapitulation the two of the exposition in reverse order the backwards recapitulation is technique that frequently because of the formal symmetry it for example the fifth string quartet see on that diagram of the form of the movement the symmetry is apparent within the seven following the introduction as the example the development section is divided into three the first and third draw their thematic material from the first theme group and the second subsection new material not drawn from the exposition on either side of the middle section of the development we have the alternation which the overall form with the exception of the symmetric paul wilson also the inherent symmetry of the movement although his interpretation is somewhat different wilson new the and stand for and respectively example formal structure of the first movement more or less sonata harmonic as well as formal tonality in this piece and in music in general is quite different from its classical interpretation we find that the harmonic structure is at least analogous to the standard sonata form structure begin with the movement is in we say in we do not imply major or minor for that matter the major minor tonal system in general does not apply to this rather that the pitch class is the tonal center of the movement and analogously to the tonic in sonata movement this interpretation we can map out the local tonal used throughout the movement as shown in example harmonic structure of the first movement this example the divide the formal of the piece so we can immediately see that the tonic is not established until the exposition with the exposition the large scale progression of tonal is whole tone descent from to by the stemmed in while the from to through shown as and in the graph in quasi bass the middle pitch of the descent as the dominant to based on its symmetrical division of the whole tone scale and the fact that the second theme in in the exposition often applied tonic dominant relationship to pitch class and its tritone partner and even to that as compositional framework in his fifth string quartet this particular movement moving to the tonal dominant for the second theme before as chromatic passing tone between and and other shown in will be in detail in later paul wilson detailed account of the foreground activity throughout this movement in his analysis we do not seek to duplicate or substitute for his analysis will focus instead on the foreground activity to the background structure the graph in will serve as point of departure for the subsequent analysis while we will periodically refer back to some of its specific it should be understood that even when not explicitly this graph as the explanatory goal of this paper the as paul wilson out the title given to the movement as whole to apply only to the first wilson the does not relate thematically to any of the main of the fact it is the third movement that its thematic material from this the harmonic and at play here foreshadow some important of the entire piece begin with the opening motive in the and shown in pentatonic set and strongly as the tonal center the pentatonic set here is exclusively pitch class set and its throughout the movement are devoid of any associated with the pentatonic scale this set can be seen more as by product of perfect than generative element itself the perfect fourth in fact much of the and harmonic material of the entire movement and its importance is immediately evident in the with the opening bass motive the following two of this opening motive shown in and remove any doubt as to the importance of the perfect fourth and in turn diminish the importance of the pentatonic set example and example and example and from to and pitch class to the pentatonic set of six note set of the true dominance of the perfect fourth the set is ten note set derived by we begin from the final and ascend the circle of until we reach we obtain the entire set in this example note is either or left or both by fourth and the structural motion is from to the overall motion in the first is to through these are enharmonically in as and as previously this motion the initial ascent to what will eventually be whole tone descent from to the structural motion of the movement as whole is descending whole step and the melodic motion is usually ascending perfect fourth can connect the two by that the descending whole step of two ascending indeed the structural whole tone descent is often filled in with the fourth motion is in in the second theme group and as we will see it in other though not relevant enough to the background structure to be in time the motion in through from of the same sequence of two descending perfect by an ascending major second each instance of this intervallic cell is in the sequence of is the inversion of those found in the second head motive of the first theme of the exposition shown in of although there is no thematic relation between the and the main of the movement within the first we can already see structural harmonic and that apply to the movement as whole the section from is centered on upon the return of enharmonically as in measure we see that as its upper neighbor relationship is somewhat by however while there is no clear tonal center for this section in the outer in measure although the harmonic material is reminiscent of minor the concluding motive of this section in the the of as well as the bass motive of measure are related to the first head motive of the first theme which is shown in the first measure of three of these span tritone which as is the dominant relationship in this movement paul wilson the transition from the to the as quite abrupt and seemingly unmotivated wilson but it is in fact this relationship that them together and rather smooth transition example violin example measure repeated through measure the the relationship between the and the first theme of the exposition smooth the transition nearly every other element when the first theme the drastic tempo and meter as well as the first of staccato make it clear to the listener that the introduction is over as the first theme the beginning of which is in two head the first is the tritone ascent that in the first measure and the second is an iteration of the interval cell that in the second through third the presence of the perfect that was so prevalent in the is clear in the latter the former does not employ the perfect fourth in its formation this motive is small scale representation of the tonic dominant relationship of tritone specifically and that is the basis for the harmonic structure of this movement example we have dissonance between the melody which the written meter and the in the and lower the and them in meter that is more consistent with their rhythmic pattern as the are more or less in duple meter and with one hiccup in the measure is in strict metric dissonance with the triple meter of the melody with its own in the written as we will later see this dissonance when this theme in the recapitulation example lower reduced example to reflect rhythmic pattern have already that the first theme group is in is made clear from the onset both in the melodic line and by the minor triad that on the downbeat of measure the material occasionally from this in these are all subordinate to the is the tonal center for although it does not appear as strong bass note until measure contain mostly chromatic descent from to where is throughout as goal tone for the bass this structure following the arrival of in the bass is established as the tonal center for the final transition to the second theme the trombone motive in shown in is the subject of the section in part of the development although its importance is here that the initial is pickup to the section in which in the whole tone descent from to with the fourth motive also the intervallic cell of the second head motive of the first theme in the form of with the addition of some passing in addition to largely of motion by perfect example bass structure of the first theme group example trombone wilson that and are local to in this first section of the exposition wilson the strong motion from does carry tonal implication of dominant tonic such cadential bass motion does not imply anything about structural function in this context furthermore is not convincingly established as dominant tone at all the passage from is centered on and the pentatonic set from the opening of the exposition is down whole step but its mere presence as local tonic does not signify any sort of dominant function we can consider this occurrence of as level whole tone descent that the structural descent to at measure that is in the bass which might seem to support as structural dominant as previously as fake dominant that in actually as an upper neighbor to the true dominant the descent in in fact in the farce by projecting descent ending on which the eventual reinterpretation of and descent to both smooth transition to the second theme and strong sense that new section is beginning combination that is generally rather difficult to forge the second theme is tranquil and harmonically simple which is in stark contrast to the first theme as tonal center from with little or no harmonic motion away from it are in with the bass in the harp and are in between and in measure instance of the whole tone being filled in by fourth the return to in measure is also filled in in this way by in constitute the bass progression the same stepwise descent in the first theme group while rather than was being paul wilson out that substituting for within an analogous structure confirmation at this point as the crucial interior center of the movement wilson our terminology this is the point at which is unequivocally established as the structural dominant the as the development is divided into three the entire development section is by exactly three and indeed each subsection is associated with one of these three as its tonal of these is involved in the structural whole tone descent as paul wilson the development is for music developmental in relatively conventional way the from the exposition are expanded and and other than those arise wilson the only slight abnormality though it is certainly not unheard of even in classical period sonata is the emergence of new theme in the second section of the development wilson that this theme is based on transformation in rhythm and contour of the second head motive of the first theme wilson there is no intervallic relationship between the two and it is not clear what of motive remain when rhythm contour and interval content are this section being the middle section of the movement the formal symmetry if as its own theme the first section of the development with big minor chord which immediately as the tonal center for the section it to minor in measure it to minor in measure which that is an upper neighbor the passage beginning at measure shown in can be considered to be the theme of this section and is development of the second head motive of the first theme motive inversion and extension throughout the section wilson rightly the resultant set of as it as such does not offer much analytical insight until we point out that this is simple extension of the intervallic sequence from the original motive example the second section of the development is in which is sometimes section is as section to the calm simplicity and tempo of the second section though apart from affect there are no to that section the major chord in measure by major in measure as tonal center the tonality is not strongly established until measure the arrival at was by the first two of the development which are almost direct transposition of the two head of the first theme to of its emphasis here in the development section and its position as leading to in the second theme group we could conceive of as sub dominant in this movement as tempting as this interpretation may be this observation is to the section because it horrible abuse of is only so far that such tonal can go before they begin to hide any true analytical insight behind example and example reduction development part the third section of the development the trombone motive from the transition between the first and second of the exposition shown in to begin on and turns it into sequence in the tonal center is established immediately in by the strong chord progression as previously the motive the motion by perfect found in the as well as the intervallic cell found in the second head motive of the first theme the resultant set is the pentatonic set the entire passage shown in remains within this set the second and fourth of the subject are up perfect fifth but the first note is rather than which to remain in this pentatonic set and also to reinforce as tonal center example establishment of the second instance of the section not in its entirety but based on the subject in is an exact pitch inversion to begin on the inversion seamlessly back into the original subject in measure the following section especially out the within the pentatonic set so much so that is as tonal center which to emerge as the goal tone of this to be immediately as leading tone to the that the recapitulation and are chromatic to which the arrival on and out the fact that the appearance of the large scale whole tone descent that been left on for the entire development section example brass section example inverted subject the the recapitulation as we have seen the in reverse order the second theme is initially in as part of the whole tone descent and proceeds directly to where it is slightly is worth pointing out that the arrival on at measure is led into by which another filling in of the whole step by the fourth the in measure might initially seem to be new tonal area but it to in measure which chord still applied to than resolve this back to however briefly to in measure and to in measure and are both active throughout the entire transition from second theme back to first theme which out their as upper and lower chromatic to which triumphantly in measure with the much recapitulation of the first theme the return of the first theme is certainly immediately as such however there are some important its initial appearance in the exposition had minor flare to it the first chord in is an minor triad and the first four of ascend the minor scale the recapitulation of this theme shown in the first chord is an major chord and the is by in the melody fact the chord progression of the first four of can be thought of tonally as in we are reluctant to say that this passage is in major the conspicuous in measure easily doubt to this interpretation we can certainly say that the minor flare of the beginning been by major flare here in the recapitulation addition to the mode shift we notice that the metric dissonance shown in and no longer notice how regular the rhythm of the figure is in and also that the written meter no longer other the piece in becoming more regular is beginning to drive towards the of the formal structure the recapitulation of the first theme also as the section of the movement this section the feel of to is much shorter than any other major section or subsection and the tonic harmony is active throughout are also no phrase music simply forward with no pause until measure where the motive in the brass over an obvious cadence the end of the movement which as the motive example the first theme in the recapitulation is no fine line between music that is tonal and music that is atonal is one of the many early twentieth century whose music entirely in the gray area between tonality and atonality we know from his that he often composed with tonal and in mind and that he regularly applied tonal and to his by merely glancing at any one of his we can see that tonality as it is understood in the common practice period is not at work largely to the work of tonal such as heinrich and we have detailed system for tonal system however is virtually useless in music that entirely on the atonal side of the spectrum if we apply it to music such as that is in the middle area we can come up with some enlightening and perhaps unexpected do so was the goal of this analysis of the first movement of the for our tonal system to music that outside of the tonal realm we not only find the of tonality that do remain but we also pinpoint exactly when and how this music from previous is not that music great expressive now we can

rise in the scale of being the history of color is about the ways in which man tried to find the ideal state of being throughout the the reaching state of colorless ness is associated with the highest state of spiritual being the state of zen is typical of this sort of is the art of as much as possible the minimum as an ideal is apparent through japanese as well as the art of ink painting in both and japan for them reaching the of spirituality expression in its most minimal form reduction of color and expression proved the purity the artist had within himself it was of reducing down to the essence of thing the of color in the though how this ultimate state of minimalism can only be through an appreciation and fine knowledge of color artistic the suppression of externals and the reduction of all colors to black and white its real aesthetic function only against the background of highly refined sensibility for colors and their subtle other the true profundity of the beauty of black and white is disclosed only to those that are able to appreciate the of sumptuous and glowing colors with all their delicate and for black and white can only be seen as distinguishing against background of color and for this very reason one can assert that both black and white are colors in themselves as non colors is through the absence of color that one to mind the colors that are no longer present is up to the mind to fill in the blank space color one could not appreciate the purity of the black and white space colorlessness needs color in order to for the full aesthetic experience to take place is to say under the total absence of color there is vague reminiscence of all colors that have been and white are the consummation of all colors into one is life it is the infinite possibility of expression and development here is not sheer black for in its negation of all colors all colors are positively is through these that one the essence in thing society this purging of color with the rejection of of past color was way of the decadence of the century turned to minimalism as way of cleansing life modernity color moral issue seen as something sensuous and dangerous in its secondary nature to the essence of life and form the predominance of color at the expense of drawing is usurpation of the relative over the absolute of fleeting appearance over permanent form of physical impression over the empire of the soul color on the surface of an object it is superficial cosmetic and therefore deceptive since it the true nature of that thing color is associated with the from grace is something which to the not the mind it is external and therefore secondary to life with the body not the intellect from reason in the way which it and life color was permanent internal threat an ever present inner other which if unleashed would be the ruin of everything the fall of culture for charles color also kind of ruination color for him the mythical savage state out of which civilization the nobility of the human spirit slowly heroically itself but back into which it could always slide is descent in the way it one lose consciousness and enter into the physical world of desire and to desire is to lose control over oneself the cult of the black and white is seen as spirituality the heavens and light it is all which is modern it the opposite of the carnal nature of color is the control of nature and the body and the modern man is the spiritual color of our times the clearness which all out is neither grey white nor white but pure white is the color of modern times the color which whole era our era is perfection purity certitude everything have both the brown of decadence and and the blue of divisionism the cult of the blue the with green and the spectrum pure white for these black and white have been at the top of the hierarchy of colors color color the white surface color it for an eye on all the it before that it an eye on itself watching its freshly and neatly folded fabric for the stain of color colorlessness is not natural and thus superiority over this world the other hand we need color in order to distinguish black and white as those from the the purity of white what been washed away and thus the white glitter even more and black stand out because of color and color stand out because of white and black are linked intrinsically together one cannot go without the other is the setting for color mosque for example the architectonic effect of its white garment is by strategic use of color these are in majestic coat of whitewash the stand out clearly the impeccable construction all its boldness times high stylobate of delightful ceramic blue vibration the sensuous vibration of the color the white surface whose limit it need this opposition between color and non color to make distinction between the two otherwise neither would hold such significance to harmonize colors that would otherwise clash it together and certain incorporeality the use of white is therefore decisive for the bodily appearance of space decrease the space more or less depending on their color value white one can actually establish the intensity of colors white the tone in the first place of this it is possible to take up any given colors and make them harmonize for this reason white are favored over colored for both and architectural the white of the the color of what is set before them and because it to light the of the space the white painted room the clarity of spatial sensation and disposition was and most convincing all the of the form and color of the could be undisturbed in front of this this form was discovered which was completely convincing in its simplicity and which could be seen as one of the essential for wall treatment in closed is another important aspect which white is representative of and that is the well educated and socially elite the century it fashionable for bourgeois to dress in white while men dressed in black proved certain rational order only by those able to afford of it white clothing they both require much more maintenance than something colored where stain can merely hide away among the other colors whiteness on the other hand sort of luxury and leisure clothing proved that someone was of level of society in which they were not forced to work for the clothing would immediately become soiled if not and thus the reason why who were the to stay at home dressed in all white while men who were the to go out and work wore black for black did in fact hide the same goes with white in their impeccability it proved to whoever that the owner could afford to not live actually live in this space or could afford more simply for the upkeep and constant fresh of paint as well were of the modern age man had white was de partly because of its exciting novelty partly because it the smoothly mechanical texture and pointed the contrast between it and surrounding nature the use of white was proof that man had nature the use of white and black in dress and architecture also way of distinguishing oneself from the vulgar normal lower classes it is also worthy of remark that savage uneducated people and have great predilection for vivid colors that are excited to rage by certain colors that people of refinement avoid vivid colors in their dress and the that are about them and seem to banish them altogether from their presence with the of industrialization the invention of new synthetic meant that color in dress for all classes anyone could afford to wear colorful clothing and the to dress themselves in what once would have been inconceivable to them said the use of black in white in wardrobe perhaps was way for the new bourgeoisie to distinguish themselves from the decadence of the upper class and the vulgarity from the low the of the european bourgeoisie there long tendency to limit the use of color with strong emphasis on what are generally thought of as non colors such as white black and gray the reason why it is that the bourgeoisie took preference in black and white is because of the victorian sobriety of the age and their obsession with purity and cleanliness black and white also marked the distinction of labor between men and and in highly rigid and segmented society the wearing of different colors the most obvious way to do so simplicity of dress was seen as mark of the modern man major during the age of industrialization also had an effect on this preference for black and white took over as of portraiture for the bourgeois and the upper class and despite the fact that it was possible to color the for the most part they were left in black and white because it was seen as more natural all it is that the expanse of literacy and the printed word mainly the newspaper had profound effect in the choice of black and white world was as orderly and relatively uniform world in black and white led to the idea of writing rationality production that confined especially in color to the field of art which was understood as an essential activity but one that was essentially unproductive while it assigned to the two toned and orderly world of printed paper the role of daily guide to existence the the world of print was therefore seen as something serious for the modern man and white symbol for the superiority of intellect and technology then down into the world of fashion as seen with the distinction between black and white clothing as well as art namely photography but also film and as before architecture and gallery space as since the time of form was valued over that of color the which did not require color to be were to be that of higher form the explosion of mass production and printing for plethora of colorful advertising and consumer goods which came to be known as is product of the industrial revolution which the of and america and established what is universal literacy order to meet the demand of mass cheap and bright of little use were made to attract the attention of made cheap what once was truly cultural by the way it it by saying for raw material the and simulacra of genuine culture and this insensibility is the source of its is mechanical and by is vicarious experience and according to style but remains always the same is the epitome of all that is spurious in the life of our times to demand nothing of its except their money not even their time the of came great need for the distinction between higher and lower guard at the time was considered to be true art while this was simply pure imitation said this along with the influence of black and white print perhaps was the cause for the belief that which was black and white was serious high art while that which was colorful was mere rubbish and imitation for the lower classes course during the early of color film and photography the quality was so poor that it gave cheap look whereas black and white film really one to see the light and the in the for the play of light and form was key in the true art form was what made up the essence of an image not the artificial or superficial filling in of form with color was thought to distract the viewer from the soul of the image have since color technology as to the point of being almost better than reality though black and white is seen as something of more sober tradition still use black and white and white is still the most widely used color for within gallery non colors allow for the appreciation of color something is black and white it the mind to fill in and imagine for itself the amazing colors that must exist beyond the screen actually with the invention of color in that this stunted the mind since one was forced to look at the garish colors before them is for this reason that ultimately the use of black and white is seen as more of an intellectual process one to imagine it one to delve into the core of the object it mean going beyond the mind or simply the purity of non color the use of black and white been over for the last hundred we have an era where we are seeing once again more color but perhaps it is human instinct to want to surpass and rebel against before so possibly we shall return to state of non color veneration is the ebb and flow of life the debate over homosexuality been one of the most long lasting and controversial ever exactly homosexuality would say it is gene on from to child would argue that it is result of more would claim that it is mental illness that can and should be then it is combination of some of these no one for sure and it is possible no one ever will but that surely does not stop everyone from coming up with their own and on the matter homosexuality as far back as ancient and other of the time where it was considered to be very normal and natural occurrence his book the wrote those who are halves of man whole pursue and being so to speak of the male love men throughout their boyhood and take pleasure in physical contact with men in that not only did consider it normal for male to be to another male he also that it at very young age as the word boyhood fact even considered love between two of the same sex to be the only real and lasting love and necessary for democracy there were many of homosexual behavior in greek mythology hercules is to have had male and zeus himself partook in such behavior homer wrote about and who have been considered to be the perfect model of true love it was not until that the term homosexual was first used to describe man or woman whose of sexual attraction are for someone of the same sex for the of this paper homosexuality will be at solely in of men this point in time karl maria used the word in pamphlet which fought to repeal the current of derived this word from the greek word for same and the latin word for sex whereas heterosexual is person whose of sexual attraction are for the opposite sex was also in the when the debate itself over the cause of homosexuality was by magnus physician sex researcher leading sexologist homosexual and founder of the first gay movement in who that homosexuality was biological in nature also the committee which was mostly homosexual in the committee many and other of literature which gave great amount of prestige in his field known as one of the founding of sexology and this position when he the first sexological institute the institute for in in which was by the later largely the theory of karl with minor he in some hormonal as cause of homosexuality but this only led to unsuccessful to cure with the use of hormone theory which defined as who turned to other as sexual was in twelve by starting the first while the second which shortly after the first scientific theory of homoerotic desire that were to other because they were of the mind meaning while they may have been male in body they were female in soul and mind leading them to be naturally to in of sexual he made such as paragraph law adopted by king william throughout the german at the time of their unification which forbade sex between and forced criminal upon in such behavior unfair and unreasonable that the origin of such disposition was natural and inborn couple thousand after and homer sigmund still homosexuality to be natural behavior an interview in he professed his am of the firm conviction that must not be as sick people are not sick also do not belong in court of law in he his when he wrote now famous to an american of homosexual which stated that is assuredly no advantage but is nothing to be ashamed of no vice no degradation it cannot be classified as an illness highly respectable of ancient and modern times have been in the general public of the and early the medical homosexuality as curable mental illness such as castration hysterectomy lobotomy and electroshock therapy were used as the mid psychotherapy the most common cure and many spent countless being in of their sexual preference evelyn heterosexual psychologist ground breaking study in the mid that went along similar reasoning as this courageous experiment the psychological of sixty men half homosexual and half heterosexual disagreed with the popular belief at the time that homosexuality was mental illness and that there was no significant psychological difference between homosexual and heterosexual men gay men were no more insane than their straight many prominent also that homosexuality was not an illness and their along with the innovative study by who been to as the rosa of the gay movement convinced the american of to vote to remove homosexuality from the and as mental illness in december of over year later the american also removed homosexuality from their list of mental the american further reiterated this belief when an overwhelming majority of the of adopted the on therapeutic to in which publicly those who to cure homosexuality by of various of treatment stated rather that homosexuality was merely difference in the opinion and of the common person but must still be as an individual orientation and thus as one on therapeutic to one of the most famous on this topic was in by michael an assistant professor of psychology at and richard an associate professor of psychiatry at boston school of and found that sexual orientation in is largely due to genetics for two these men studied the number of of homosexuality in both monozygotic or identical set of coming from the same egg and thus identical and dizygotic or fraternal set of from too separate causing them to have similar but not any more so than that of two ordinary in addition to adoptive of gay meaning that all of these would have been raised in the same environment total of identical and fraternal and of male and their adopted were studied where at least one of the two had been classified as homosexual either by self identification or other of the homosexual who had identical or approximately of their identical twin were also found to be homosexual as to only or approximately of the non identical of homosexual and or approximately of the adopted of homosexual who were unrelated in of genetics enough the study also included of biological that were not and out of the homosexual studied only or about had homosexual which is approximately the normal statistical incidence of homosexuality in the general population and more people are beginning to believe that homosexuality is not choice but rather feeling that one is born with as one older they become aware of sexual towards other the only difference between and is that while are to of the opposite sex are to those of the same sex neither nor really have choice in the matter and homosexual are you to other of your sex is to heterosexual are you to of the opposite sex all why would anyone choose such difficult as homosexual one their other family and to the point of losing all contact with them their career being condemned by their religion being beat up for publicly their sexuality and much much more the only actual choice is whether or not to be open with sexuality and sexual preference whether to act on sexual whether to tell about such or whether to live whole life as lie and suppress these supplement my from research have personal with two adolescent homosexual james and daniel were how what they thought determined homosexuality nature nurture and why when they they were homosexual and how they knew and similar that homosexual was result of nature rather than nurture reasoned that most would not raise their to be homosexual not like going to be gay that he was born homosexual why he was homosexual he just the way you are you cant explain it was just born that way its like how the world was made no one really went on to explain that while his nurture did not impact his sexual orientation it did affect his view of it the role of and in sexuality he can bring you up to be open minded to homosexuality but they dont bring you up to be homosexual grew up in place where homosexuality is accepted so thats why so open about being gay accept myself or not you accept homosexuality and can be honest with yourself if you are homosexual on how brought up generally agreed with and his belief that homosexuality was by nature rather than nurture when he that theres nothing in my that exposed me to anything like homosexuality why he was gay he that it is simply something that cant help in my head nothing made me do it went on to explain that it the same thing as the primitive attraction between and only it was between and other added that nothing to make me homosexual its always been there always been to find to be extraordinary about case is that he how while he always been sexually go he is romantically to in the sense that he always and to be close with other but never in sexual sense he always kind of about getting married to female these come from his romantic side which is different from the sexual side that if he married female with which he strong trust maybe he could work it out then went back to talk about homosexuality as in innate characteristic like race all something you cant help it all comes to you internal you cant help it if he thought homosexuality was by gene he that he thought that it was more of an instinct gave the example of which are born with such as knowing how to build next or catch their prey also thought that maybe it was by something in the development of the embryo in all homosexuality as fascinating final thought also believe everyone at least one homosexual attraction not black and white homosexual heterosexual its spectrum there are against homosexuality as by genetics to theory of natural selection the advantageous are on while the disadvantageous eventually die out for instance heterosexual have an average of five times as many as homosexual as female is to reproduce yet are by definition not sexually to from the evolutionary standpoint homosexuality becomes one of the disadvantageous consequently heterosexual men contribute five times as much genetic information to the next the gene pool if homosexuality was indeed by gene it would have out entirely by now or at least been reduced immensely in the number of neither of these have yet taken place it can be that homosexuality is not by gene throughout my research have led me to conclude that there is no definitive answer on what homosexuality no one for sure now although many think they do and perhaps no one ever will know the whole truth am apt to believe that homosexuality is the product of some kind of combination of genetic and environmental one may have genetic predisposition towards homosexuality that been on from previous this does not necessarily determine homosexual rather this predisposition must be triggered by environmental is why and found in their study that while they was greatly elevated chance that two the same genetic would also share the same sexuality this was not the case of the time to be the most likely explanation as of now but even as write this new are being done the truth is right around the corner american apa and of male of james interview june charles media june richard and iowa state public ed william san diego richard eric it san francisco andrew daniel interview june amanda november asian of old the chinese legend of the snake demon that human form and becomes the wife of man lasting influence over asian and fiction for quintessential the of the from by the japanese author and under traditional chinese story are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the figure to become more believable human but also what may have given her enduring appeal both these are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this the true source of pleasure from these is the transgressive behavior not her eventual punishment for it tales of in as early as the and initially her portrayal was fairly direct as villainous demon who the life force out of her human husband lai to asian no over time of her more complex and the persona of more sympathetic and perhaps even model of the ideal confucian wife particularly in lai was loving wife mother rescuer of her family from the first flood and at that point general benefactor of man took on the of traditional chinese female particularly forbearance if she were really an ideal wife why could she not live happily with her human mate dangerous sexuality is the key might seem an unusual term to apply to character from modern chinese and japanese literature who may exemplify the of an ideal confucian wife since it is primarily associated with film particularly those of the film noir genre this term which is relatively speaking neologism the were around the beginning of the century oxford english oxford dictionary entry single query type word first to show is an apt description of the depiction of and all her to woman who is dangerously attractive and men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness both of snake the depict her as bewitchingly beautiful her human lover in of the cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and of her and himself disturbed and by her ethereal beauty of and english of the japanese of of the of british columbia bewitching beauty her lover into his and the next morning he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business under the diana in ma and joseph chinese and boston of these align negative with her beauty suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction addition to sexuality the irregular characterization of might be another trait her character in common with the archetypical noir her essay the noir film from feminist perspective christine only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or deceiver but the is itself so that it is not evident to the audience whether she the stereotype or not christine and in and ann oxford both each characterize fairly consistently within their the uneven characterization in film noir perhaps the evolution of her character over time may not be sure whether she is pure villainess or whether she is good wife who is badly by society because there is evidence of both throughout her legend is loyal wife to her husband as she but she also him to find trouble with the law and him about her supernatural nature the in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent of these simple reading of the story might produce the idea that dangerous female aggression and sexuality that traps the man and she must be and by society is quite similar to the end for the fatal character in she is in some way so that social order and proper gender are both secret is uncovered and monk comes to exorcise her and she is eventually powerless and trapped under pagoda husband becomes monk and this further this time from buddhist perspective beauty is dangerous thing that men to the transitory world and them from being free from desire and ascending to lover is far from the ideal man is weak willed and not particularly useful the priest those took advantage of your fair and you you yourself owing to lack of courage and spirit fell victim to their temporary form the of this are that more capable man would not fall for the trickery are the morals of these entirely sincere they were would be unmistakably as an evil character both these feature many where have great sympathy for her despite her depraved sexuality admire her patience and loyalty everywhere and now that at last found you very happy she to him in must also acknowledge that her human lover is breaking his promise to her when he leaves her with him have love bond between us as constant as the tai and the eastern and we must live and die together since we are already married take me back and stay together the rest of our that be wonderful another traditional vernacular story the in the jew in richard ho in ma and joseph chinese and boston the male protagonist promise he made to his concubine lover and for it suggesting that traditionally loyalty and keeping word was valued on the part as well as her failure to follow through on his end of the bargain completely forgetting the love he once had for her more sympathetic to plight no matter how much sympathy may gather from the story still with her trapped under the pagoda draw from the long tradition of supernatural and ghost which usually end with the demon or at least subdued the initial of this story her human lover so her entrapment under pagoda by taoist monk or later buddhist monk lai would have been satisfying ending of early of the story might have been cheering for the defeat of this demon disguised as beauty and would have reading the for the lurid horror and later her crushing defeat the of the two here do not give motivation to wish for the death of so the pleasure of the narrative to borrow appropriate phrasing from film theory comes not from the death of the insubordinate disruptive force from watching the themselves an essay on the of film noir that the strong behavior of the female the moral supposedly by their morals at the end the final lesson of the myth often into the background and we retain the image of the erotic strong unrepressed if destructive woman in in in ann british these two the is going to live on in the of not as the shrunken snake trapped under pagoda but the sexy aggressive woman who took human man as her lover resistant reading of the text may be too colored by modern since it is impossible to know for certain what in the past about these consciously or unconsciously these female character who the of feisty heroine fact in the in the her as feminist symbol for who rebel against the patriarchy lai as the dangerous of noir as heroine in her own right rather than the sexy death trap for the male protagonist so too should be for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly outside the of conventional social the of the ohio by and to the in alexis january of the american montezuma september is date that few people in ohio will ever forget that date president of and that most of the steel would close for other this would simply be minor economic setback for the people of and the surrounding area it meant disaster was one industry area and the people of and the numerous other small and in the area only had one main employer the steel the that would follow this date known as monday are seen by the people who them either as of great courage and determination or as to human failure and false hope than sit back and wait for their to be snatched away the and local union in the fought long and hard to be able to keep the open collectivization and even the of steel headquarters were all in desperate movement by those in the industry to preserve the only source of employment that this town had well intentioned ultimately leaving with and distinct lack of trust in fellow humankind why did the brave by union and concerned to revive the steel industry ultimately fail examining the history culture and economic situation we can identify four main the refusal of the international leadership of of america to support their branch the lagging international steel market the lack of clear organized vision for individual such as the and crippling regionalism which animosity between different small in the region all in some way to the failure of the and union to save the industry importantly the problem in was nationwide problem it affected and the surrounding area more than it affected other the local people simply could not solve national crisis on local level of in ohio james and daniel discovered ore and coal lining creek in an area outside of known as blast furnace was the very first blast furnace in the area the vital role in the army with iron also was major railway crossroads due to its strategic position between and fact rail under the major bridge in per day than any other location in the country the century the center of iron had gradually from the far and eastern pennsylvania to the ohio of the the and the region of ohio and kentucky population had grown to nearly which meant it had doubled in size over twenty year period the town continued to prosper driven by the flux of pouring in with the of employment at the prosperity continued until the late when the hit the area hard the of successful to establish national steel union the industry barely the the outbreak of the made iron and steel important again and was out of its economic standstill into fast paced period of booming growth may have been an important and prosperous region in the post war period but the for its downfall were slowly being sown the town during the forties and and they were often long and bloody the was and lockout and driving productivity and laborer morale down the same time governmental for environmental protection and the growth of steel were making it harder to produce and market american steel and the overeager in the stock were pushing for more and more of their share of the pie importantly steel were slowly becoming less efficient and more expensive old technology was not obsolete were not and almost none of the were being to help modernize was recipe for disaster that would soon explode in the of of of and their monday and the of the the announcement of the of the in was the beginning of downward spiral which would send the entire valley into chaos and ruin and total of five were closed and approximately were lost of union and mill were hurriedly set up in an attempt to persuade the that be to reconsider their statement it was clear that in the of president lloyd you cant make buck you get out of the business the meant the end of only real industry the end of its population growth and then end of economic progress the people sought other of employment in adjoining or even other of the country those that could afford to move did so those that afford to move mostly ended up on the streets an industrial or residential base commerce shrank considerably was becoming increasingly clear that without the industrial base provided by the the city of would soon become ghost town inhabited by those too poor or hopeful to escape the decided they to do something to save their city and so they in variety of ways to the the very first thing that the could do was to get up petition to stop the shutdown ed mann local union leader and organizer the petition was eventually of it was then given to to present to carter in washington the were to the side and in washington since political influence had with its industry the chapter of the had much more power but they to support the local union the petition was lost among and bureaucratic procedure decided to form the an organization of local religious which the attempt to reopen the works the drafter to the if group of might purchase the mill and run it collectively the so the turned once again to the federal government too they were the had no proper funds to buy the so they could do nothing but sit back and watch as the closed following the shutdown of plant in local union outside the in local people and to witness the scene then the and took it over the stayed there until the next day when declared that they were ready to talk about selling the mill after the left the building steel told the local union that they had their and were no longer interested in the to purchase the mill these eventually came to nothing and steel closed to save the were by several major the decline of the world steel market which made american steel impossible to sell or export the of the the to save the partly because the international market for steel had largely dried up the rest of the world was hungry for iron and steel however by the no foreign to import steel in such large fact american steel were beginning to outweigh steel was easier and more efficient to make and was often of higher quality than domestic steel steel in their their technology and their equipment often meant that foreign were more modern and efficient than any in america and therefore were able to export more competitive product steel was also much although they to improve living of steel in the made american steel far more expensive international drew on large supply of very cheap labor were scarce in other steel and labor were either non existent or to pay much less for work in america continued to go up of their while overseas were able to cut labor and put that money back into and their scale such as aluminum plastic and were beginning to substitute steel both at home and abroad demand was beginning to decline and it affected both domestic and foreign to american already suffering financial outdated machinery and fierce competition this lack of demand was an inconvenience they could not afford steel unsold flooding the world market with inferior that no one to buy this problem was national one rather than local one the that were in were not unique was perhaps hit harder than any other town by the collapse of the steel industry but it was not alone the problem was national one many more and than alone philip union member and organizer of many to save summed it up thus just cant solve nation wide problem in single city the decline of the world steel market affected not just but the entire steel community in america trying to prop up one was impossible when faced with the depression that spread throughout the entire industry the of and some religious involved in the within community and former steel mill to create the as the name local to instill the people of with fierce sense of urgency driving them forward to confront steel and and help secure the future of the region and letter writing were all employed to help stimulate the and rally the people the was down heavily by the lack of proper the people of being now unemployed had very little money to spend on anything but alive tuition clothes food and heating all had to come before to non profit outside of the area had no personal investment in the and so it was difficult to convince anyone from out of the county to contribute funds the lack of money proved to be crippling because it the involved from the to run collectively funds the could do nothing major to help salvage the dying economy the also one essential component an actual concrete plan no one to know just how to go about fixing the and were all very well but they did little to improve the situation clung to vague of worker collectivization but no one could really fathom exactly how that would work the people of were after all not particularly familiar with socialism or collectivization in general that no one knew how they should proceed everyone knew that saving the was important but nobody stepped forward with full plan to do it without losing huge of money and dragging even more people down real plan nothing could truly be funds to drive the or even real plan of action the did more harm than good effect it raised the of without any real chance at saving anything excited and for the to reappear but they never did the to save any and was into economic chaos the of of america was the union the steel when the hit many assumed that their union would take lead role in fighting for the recovery of their it soon clear that although the local union were prepared to fight the international branch was not the higher of the union increasingly with and its plight to shut out the from and local union and to ignore what was really happening one main reason for the behavior of the was that union really had no idea what to do no one had ever seen shutdown of this magnitude and rapidity before and none of the of not even president lynn knew what could be done was clear to everyone that the economic from this series of would be one of the worst in history and so without any real the union were than try and come up with some sort of scenario the simply what was going on in that perhaps the problem would resolve itself or at least not spread any further than it already had incompetence the had one other major reason for their local counterpart fear of socialism the union itself was not afraid of socialist action but they worried that the federal government might see the of to collectivize as movement towards socialism and perhaps even communism the the to revive the and worker control and ownership of the then the government and potentially other important people and as well might begin to think that the were encouraging socialism would mean that would lose credibility with the american government and its people something they could not afford to do they decided to withdraw support and let the local branch fight it out alone its very first days the been an area with small and is the name of the major city area but surrounding it on all sides are small which to the casual viewer are indistinguishable from the main city itself warren canfield and many other and are crowded around see from each town work shop eat and socialize in separate from their own making each town strongly dependent on every

and she ran back to was gone and there wasnt anything she could do about it there she sat her falling through the splashing silently into the earth beneath the tree sobbing for the loss of her trainer had her tai do so she could learn more self defense knew plenty now but that didnt stop the pain of losing best friend sat her face buried in her up close to her chest when she running actually pray to anthony for me she for the billionth time as your hand over the door knob have been in her foyer for the past three while you find to not say to one another an extensive search of her bedroom during which she her middle school yearbook you laugh at her frizzy hair and braces she the book back and snaps it shut lacy black bra which she quickly away in drawer furiously pink and twenty to her delight her diamond earring is still missing promising to spend the rest of the day praying to the of you optimistically remind her that at least she one earring left she reluctantly but some are meant to be pair day the irony may very well kill you re the she thought to herself the from her face momentarily from her mourning up to clearing in the to get better view of what was happening boy he about fifteen but he was short was running insanely quickly from two men probably around their mid were chasing him could tell they were armed by the way their clothes over like their or their was not only gifted with various such as stealth the ability to move silently invisibly and extremely quickly but she was very observant down from the tree her stealth power to get next to the boy running into step with him over at her going on him matching his pace easily the the boy amazed that she could keep up you think you were the only one with certain the why are they chasing you aware that the men were catching up should know the boy was just walking through town when those two up and me ran for it and they been following me since then he why don we give them slip she winking at him good to me both invisibly off to the left the two men came to halt not knowing where the had gone and the boy could still see each other in sort of mirror world of the regular one the mirror world was much than the real world which is why they so much faster when cloaked by their would appear as running when traveling in the mirror realm that is if anyone in the real world was able to see them stopped as did the boy who are you and owen and you are eyed him suspiciously at the question she over at the two moving in slow motion around and over to where they had been standing to make sure that they

up to it filled first with excitement and then with concern was moaning and occasionally it lamenting phrase in some incomprehensible language and ran down its face saw that instead of normal nose and

explosion of glass my at my clothing hundred mile per hour immediately shooting me out into the opening spinning me around and around until felt cold stone underneath them my marble floor lay underneath me richard part its turn came the private secretary somewhat apologetically laid the letter in front of the in mrs austin probation officer of he letter about been of theft up for sentence tuesday repeated arnold fellow stenographer used to do your last summer going in and out on the train the great man remember about him the habitual gloom of the private secretary was by grin on the loose had with him about five hundred belonging to the firm with now shoe people on woman and woke up without the money the next morning he to make good but in policeman they into it they found the boy had been drunk tried to withdraw the charge but been the probation officer is trying to get the judge to suspend sentence letter from you sir would was evident the mind of the great man was elsewhere men who drunk or sober spent the money on who before sunrise did not appeal to him letter that morning had come from his art agent in florence he had discovered the he had been sent to find was undoubtedly genuine and he to be instructed by cable the price was forty thousand one eye closed and the other keenly regarding the inkstand mr decided to pay the price and with the facility of long practice the and snapped his mind back to the present had letter from us when he left didnt he he he into he left us he his the secretary the letter and slipped another in its place homer the landscape man he permission to use blue flint on the new road with turf and to plant silver each side it will run to about five thousand mile no the great man firmly blue flint country place look like cemetery too much like cemetery now he impatiently only idea is to insult nature the place was better the day bought it when it was running wild you could pick all the way to the that it should have to him the great man he always took in bunch of them for his mother you remember we used to see him before breakfast wandering around the grounds mr briskly like his taking to his mother it was to his mother the secretary gloomily he picked the anyway mr didnt pick our he had the run of the house in those days as far as we know he he was satisfactory say more than that the secretary scribbled mark with his pencil the landscape man him want wood road suitable to farm and to let the grow where god them as his car slid downtown on tuesday morning the mind of arnold was with such of daily routine as the purchase of railroad the japanese loan the new wing to his art gallery and an attack that morning in his own newspaper upon his pet trust his busy mind was not too to return the of the traffic who the way for him by some genius of memory to recall the fact that it was on this morning young was to be for theft was charming morning the spring was at full tide and the air was sweet and clean mr considered whimsically that to send man to jail with the memory of such morning clinging to him was year to his sentence he had not given the probation officer letter the young man now and favorably shy silent youth deft in work and at other times conscious and embarrassed that on the part of stenographer in the presence of the in was not unnatural mr had put even royalty frayed impecunious royalty on the lookout for its ease the hood of the car was down and the taste of the air warmed by the sun was grateful was at this time year before that young picked the spring to take to his mother year from now where would young be was characteristic of the great man to act quickly so quickly that his declared he was slave to impulse was these same leading so invariably to success that made his call him the forward and touched the shoulder at the of he he to do would take but few word personal word from him to the district attorney or the judge would be enough that sunday had once calculated that the working time of arnold brought him in two hundred minute that rate keeping out of prison would cost thousand of the sunshine mr stepped into the gloom of an rotunda shut in on every side hung by lit many overhead by dirty skylight the place was damp the air acrid with the smell of stale tobacco juice and foul with the presence of many unwashed policeman stolidly toward an elevator shaft and other him further on to the office of the district attorney arnold breathed more freely was again among his own people could not help but appreciate the dramatic of the situation that the man in should appear in person to plead for humble and brother knew he could not escape recognition his face was too well known but he for the sake of the would make no display of his visit deprecatory laugh he why he had come the outburst of approbation he had did not follow the district attorney ran his finger briskly down printed card henry he thats your man part judge is in that court to the door of his private office he an alert broad shouldered young man of of much indiscretion and with charming and inconsequent manner mr is interested in henry coming up for sentence in part this morning to speak for him him over with you the district attorney shook quickly and to his private office mr took out cigarette and as he crossed the floor lit it with me he puzzled slightly but enjoying withal the novelty of the environment and the curtness of his reception mr decided that in his ignorance he had wasted his own time and that of the attorney should at once have sent in his card to the judge as he understood it mr was now him to that dignitary and in moment he would be free to return to his own which were the of two mr led him to an office bare and small and him chair and handed him morning newspaper were people waiting in the room strange people only like those mr had seen on ferry forward toward young mr fawning their wide with apprehension mr the newspaper thought was going to see the judge he doesnt open for few yet said the assistant district attorney judge is always late anyway mr suppressed an exclamation to protest but his clear mind him that there was nothing against which with reason he could protest could not complain because these people were not apparently aware of the sacrifice he was making had come among them to perform kindly act that he must not stultify it by show of irritation had precipitated himself into game of which he did not know the was all time he would know better time he would send clerk he was not without sense of humor and the situation as it now was forced upon him struck him as amusing good and for the desk telephone may use this he spoke to the office he would be few late directed what should be done if the market in certain way gave rapid on many different to have read to him cablegram he from and one from vienna answer each other was his final instruction like peace mr with genial patience had silent he turned upon his levantine burly unshaven and soiled towered truculently above him mr with his swivel chair back his behind his head his cigarette hanging from his the man dispassionately hell of nerve to come to see me he cheerfully mr the form of greeting was novel greatly did it differ from the procedure of his own office that he with interest it you young in puzzled tone or your brother who tried to knife me mr unaccustomed to cross the pavement to his office unless by bank and plain clothes men felt the room growing rapidly smaller the figure of the truculent greek to heroic the hand of the banker went vaguely to his chin and from there fell to his pearl pin which he hastily covered out said young and dont show your face here the door upon the flying greek swung his swivel chair so that over his shoulder he could see mr dont like his face he kindly eyed sad woman with basket on her knee upon with the familiarity of an old acquaintance that woman going to get divorce from my son she now that in trouble that in corrected mr so it son of yours mrs bernard he declared emphatically is no good the brutality mr for the woman he felt thrill of sympathy but at once saw that it was superfluous the secure and lofty of motherhood mrs bernard down upon the assistant district attorney as upon naughty child did not even deign protest continued merely to smile the smile of the smile on the face of mother in painting by murillo he had lately to the chapel in the college he had given to his native town son of yours repeated young is leech you his wife thing ever did for was to send him up the river the mother upon him beseechingly you give me pass she said flung up his and to that just like mother he son of hers broken her heart on her her left her cent and she comes to me for pass so she can kiss him through the bet got cake for him in that basket the mother happily she knew now she would get the pass mr from the depth of his wisdom are all like that your mother my mother you went to jail your mother would be just like that mr bowed his head politely had never considered going to jail or whether if he did his mother would bring him cake in basket there were many and of life not included in his experience sprang to his and with the force of hose flushing gutter swept his soiled into the hall on he to the the court is open the were many people and with his on the broad of the assistant district attorney his way through them the people who blocked his progress were of the class unknown to him were anxious furtive miserable stood in little listening eagerly to sharp faced lawyer or in sullen despair eying each other door tipstaff laid his hand roughly on the arm of mr all right joe young mr with the court and down an aisle to enclosure in which were high oak in his effort to follow mr was but the first tipstaff came to his rescue right he with mr mr pointed to one of the oak sit there he its reserved for of the bar but its all right with slightly bewildered the banker sank between the arms of chair felt he had lost his individuality had become his sponsor of he was had pull he was permitted to sit as an equal among police court no longer was he arnold was merely the man with mr even abandoned him the be here in minute now said the assistant district attorney and went inside enclosure in front of the bench he another assistant

he in vaudeville mr it was evident that young had entirely forgotten him arose and touched his sleeve infinite sarcasm mr are not pressing but court attendant beat with his palm upon the rail down whispered the judge is coming mr sat down the court attendant loudly mr could not distinguish was rustle of silk and from door behind him the judge stalked past was young man the type of the tammany politician his shrewd alert irish american was an expression of unnatural gloom smile mr that it was as little to the countenance of the young judge as was the robe to his mr was still smiling when young over the rail up he mr stood up the court attendant had more unintelligible every one sat down and the financier again hurriedly to the rail would like to speak to him now before he he whispered cant wait mr in amazement the banker had not the young man could look so serious to him the district attorney got to wait till your man comes up you speak to the judge the voice of faded away in horror knowing in what way he had offended but convinced that it was only by the grace of he had dungeon mr to his arm chair the clock on the wall him that already he had given to young one hour and

reading speech assured his honor that he must have more time to prepare his case was one of immense importance the name of most respectable business house was involved and sum of no less than nine hundred hundred the contrast struck mr sense of humor full in the he and found himself as conspicuous as though he had suddenly in his night clothes the beat upon the rail the lawyer he had interrupted an indignant exclamation came hurriedly toward him and the young judge slowly turned his head those he said who cannot respect the dignity of this court will leave it as he spoke with his fixed on those of mr the latter saw that the young judge had suddenly him the fact of his identity did not cause the frown to relax or the rebuke to halt unuttered even icy the judge continued it is well they should remember that the law is no respecter of and that the dignity of this court will be enforced no matter who the offender may happen to be slipped into the chair beside mr and sympathetically he whispered have you wont be long now he added encouragingly as soon as this fellow his argument the take up the man to have other are here and the type writer firm who taught him but what say will help most wont be more than couple of now couple of mr inwardly couple of in this place where he had been publicly thin shark like smile those who made it their business to study his on

row he whispered mrs did tell you are all alike not taken her off you since court her one best bet mr raised his head saw little white haired woman who at him her was the same look he had seen in the of men who at times of panic fled to him beseeching entreating forcing upon him what was left of the wreck of their if only he would save their honor here come the whispered man from the last long line guarded in front and rear into the court room and as ordered ranged themselves against the wall them were old men and young well dressed clever looking collarless fierce eyed smooth shaven thin lipped his head hanging with white and ashen and his heavy with shame mr had risen and in farewell was holding out his hand to turned and across the court room the of the financier and the stenographer met the sight of the great man crimson and then his look of despair slowly and into his there came incredulously hope and gratitude turned his head suddenly to the wall mr stood irresolute and then sank back into his chair the first man in the line was already at the railing and the put to him by the judge were being repeated to him by the other assistant district attorney and court attendant were in turn repeated to the judge married citizen lutheran die cutter by profession the probation officer her filled with bustled forward and whispered mrs austin continued the

drag her husband from the pillory the judge bowed toward the probation officer and she the prisoner to her part men and in the fortune of each mr found himself to his surprise taking personal interest was as good as play him of the he had seen in in their little sordid these were in their proper in real of life he did not know but which to something that had been long untouched long in disuse was an uncomfortable sensation that left him restless because as he it expression an outlet found this partially in praising through the young judge who had publicly him mr found him astute sane his intelligent his just this probation officer she too was capable was she not at his interest in what to him was an old story the younger man like her whispered the great man her clear and clean skin me as able full of energy and yet womanly men when they come under her charge he eagerly need money to start again dont they spoke anxiously he had found the clew to his restlessness was desire to help to be of use to these who had fallen and who were being to their at him curiously you give her he would be well you will tell me her name and address whispered the banker was much given to charity but it had been perfunctory it was extended on the advice of his secretary helping here he felt genial glow of personal pleasure was much more satisfactory than giving an old to his private chapel the rear of the court room there was scuffle that every one to turn and look man who had tried to force his way past the was being violently and as he he waved paper toward mr the banker him as his chief clerk rose anxiously man to get to you see what it is its important mr him back it is he said dryly cant see him now busy the long line of of of prey of sorry weak before the seat of judgment mr had

in his chair and to mr was finished was free and from different of the courtroom people were moving toward the door that the of the young man had been many mr felt certain twinge of disappointment

enclosure when him by name honor he said impressively to speak to you the judge over his desk and shook mr by the hand he made speech the speech was about public spirited who to the neglect of their

corridor was with himself and with his fellow men shook with and them upon their public spirit and the type writer firm upon their public spirit then he saw standing apart regarding him doubtfully did not offer his hand but mr took it and shook it and said want to meet your mother when mrs tried to stop sobbing long enough to tell him how happy she was and how grateful he instead told her what fine son she had and that he when used to carry to town for her she it too and him for the he told when went bankrupt which at the rate they were giving away their money to the hebrew would be very soon

only difference between them and their is that the fleeced the profit from their hispanic don mean to sound cynical suppose wish to show that still capable of certain authorial distance semblance of dispassionate observation the following may indicate otherwise fine tourist tradition most on vega are was the and its outer were coral pink they mood sensitive they would have as first them the rental agent an attractive was not mood sensitive either said beautiful it instinct was to gesture curtly with cupped hand that she lift the wind boat and take me elsewhere she was young and attractive as have said and may say again and eager and so happy to be the infamous that merely raised an eyebrow in mild then because playwright cannot resist promising line said should be put to sleep say her face fell would do disservice to and to literature me my self as you would those of dying man when convince my to permit the wipe there will be another one who no more of or vega than he

thrust forward slightly as she to speak caught herself slid her jaw infinitesimally back into place and said don like it could do clapped her shoulder to show was not laughing at her it hate it despise it abhor it gaudy graceless pretentious house is an affront to taste and intelligence should buy it to raze it but am not so kind hearted might however rent it think she only the last of my speech will me me around and then shall decide course stop calling me even is so polite me you wish beg you change the color of the at the very least of course the house from pink to lavender that at

am the issue or the issue itself deal with the first it to remember am capable of love am not had the perfect mirror for my narcissism as for the issue itself no longer sure what want to record the playwright in me every scene of our time together the editor no only those that are relevant the sufferer no only those which cause no pain the artist no only those which cause the most pain for those

file is not even the and thought knew the in this file would walk through net show in half an hour and just before an ad for she is not the whole of what on vega must also write about gabriel you know our style well enough to tell that time between the last sentence and this another spree at least not like the other have been re reading all our favorite neither of us care to dwell on such boring do we want to pick up with and me walking about the and then for the sake of literary convenience to say that from corner of the yard saw neighboring house and the sight filled me with the truth is that pointed it out from the one place where it could barely be seen and only felt envy that it had been designed by someone with good taste there no one is always more boring than fiction for did not move into until four or five after we how does one speak to one future self the do not plan to write book this narrative must move more quickly and that evening after good dinner of at her apartment made some small joke afterward about of her firm business and she cried her to suspect her into the the next day and she gave up her apartment three later to join me was the sort of romance that so rarely

she spent another day she would become one did not like my had her because was famous and amusing and not as had hoped because was great artist yes and me until that she was by most and did not like being spectator often told her that she should have check to see if she from some metabolic imbalance often told her too many and you find he master of the moment school of sculpture the only praise for his work compare his to those of is to compare to living the illusion of reality paraphrase his entry in by doing life size in the full round never the easier frontal or three quarters view he never did of famous people his works were therefore the reality and could never be to it as is typical of his school his are sealed in the shimmer of light on their always us that we re looking at an

mistrust light from forgotten snagged itself on metal in the fluttering the themselves might have fallen on the and the event would have been no less strange no less miraculous great artist will grace this world then was never tolerant of my ego this more famous than me person like meet him jealous old one bad thought he could free me from you wrapped her arms around my stomach never be free of me old man the next evening she with stack of glistening in their and fresh plucked from their hydroponic about the reason for her extravagance how work had gone that day emil came in taking emil no

reverse of you with those ridiculous stomach old men should be fat emil am jealous eat two tonight then we did make love been thinking about the now two days away said that those who forget the past are to repeat it fear that may be true for me this to the write now to remember something perhaps even to learn emil after sundown carrying small package wrapped in what like real paper evening dress was formal expensive and slightly as that of all forgetful should be was jovial man with an easy laugh and even than had him immediately me emil must be told me much about you of it outrageous praise of it ah she is wonderfully perceptive raised an eyebrow then she said as much about me you are genius come in you into the living room he said beautiful house glad you came after dark by accident or design had found an innocently erotic posture on the couch where she lay with book of emil leapt up did not expect you early on time but you re at the package that for your kindness in inviting stranger into your home it out and with delighted snatched it from him to rip away the paper stopped writing and only the thought that might miss the kept me from another spree went walking but after rio no fit abode for creature of flesh from this hotel to the old city past the end of the and to the hard cracked pavement of left me alone they fellow ghost returned and slept and now the is thirteen away the side of parcel gave way to reveal caught in sheen of solid air of leaf mold flew from under his as he ran to greet friend or bringer of food in awe said been visiting you eh said pet around here somewhere suppose he was to the commotion up the hill ah said said little fellow with big furry else could he be handed the sculpture to me almost it it to weigh no more than said as if he might not have known last piece was of four old crouched around trash fire glad someone toss that to you spoke of his art with the enthusiasm of seven year old should wait to importune you but shyly confession and then request then you must forgive me for being so forward not easy for me to ask favor said easy for me to turn one down at me and decided was the surprising thing is that was last show was glorious said was kindly received he said an artist who would stay first among his can tell when he to fail hoped no one would bring up my last three must change my subject matter no more or want to do more traditional spoke quickly prepared to be you permit me to do one of you would pay said ah lightly said an honor course said why cannot take payment you turned to you as well the two of you together at the idea of being as she undoubtedly thought it by emil herself she said casually then she loudly at herself in the way that always made me think how much her and said god yes yes yes for perfect moment emil and and were one entity laughing until our hurt is torture had not considered that might not write to learn but to punish myself me abuse the playwright and dismiss the penultimate scene in few giving emil full to sculpture of and me we had good dinner of curried clam chowder boiled on and unstopped still steaming on and cinnamon custard for desert we went out for late swim had drunk too much confess though we all had and to argue the worth of jazz as inconsequential topic as can imagine had studied it in school so she thought herself as an expert once had neighbor who it constantly loudly and badly so thought knew it better tried to mediate but saw him as siding with think did she the subject from music to obsession with fame undoubtedly by leap that made had no choice but to follow do not remember any of this well just now nor do care to those who are truly curious may look at the last act of remember suggesting with characteristic tact that she add emil to her small list of major away embarrassed at me as if to say will said feel sorry for you see emil home said that and did not care what she did or why emil re all right something he must have as assent both up to emil home while watched the scarlet moonlight ripple on distant with but more disgusted with myself finally she would not return that night and went into the to drink myself to sleep had not come home when woke in mid morning and drank glass of and three of coffee and whether our affair could survive the of the night and whether it to should have emil to stay but even then knew that sex was not the problem between and me the problem was that have trouble distinguishing between compromise and capitulation between and substance before noon the sandy path to my apology only to pluck from between my and my the door in blood red and black silk robe ago in similar situation had broken my on someone face merely said here pursed his slightly then may see her he said night was my fault hold it against neither of you me talk to her me and at last said well through his house in silence was as attractive and as impersonal as decorator could arrange for of unknown taste tall narrow stood in the center of one room sand forever downward while of water splashed across the sand path that was work it was very minor effort then was in no mood to consider art only to despise the man who had slept with my lover was easier than myself before bedroom door should go in first prepare her surprise surprisingly well would it hurt ahead her her love her studied me then said sorry this way anticipate last night very good at making happen this way if will forgive me repeated am sorry then slipped into the next room in the dark hall warm breeze came from silent above me no until said blinked when the door filled bedroom lay nude on bed skin as smooth and as polished as the bed teak frame was looking slightly to my left smiling with trust and satisfaction like one sexually content stood her pointing something at my chest the morning sun shone fully on both of them it around the part of my mind that four in during the sent me rolling across the floor was not prepared for me to react so quickly or perhaps he too long for an expression would not have gesture would not make poignant moment of wonder despair or love he been faster he could have had rage threw chair at him as he fell onto him my pinning his arms my his neck is she me or kill to cry left this morning clothes lay by the cube the bed hit him with the back of my hand me to be famous did she will be to expect me to understand squeezing his throat until he his head madly at the sculpture at the naked of his story have together since but understood enough as knelt on his chest with my tight on his fleshy throat had made his name with home with small and on to and people who would never be he had thought to use like and me and when someone came looking he would say we had gone island in our boat would disappear into the ocean to be found or not as the wind and chose story would stand in either case him to tell me more but he begging me to forgive him to understand did not listen took the matte black from his grip and studied it not really thinking about it or or think was wondering what it meant to say that thing was art so we accepted it as art perhaps was thinking about the that humanity made that would outlive our species was probably only looking at my reflection in the lens he said then that should use it on myself might have moment at while we watched each other contorted as if they had lost their ability to shape sound turned to touch the cube that was crypt in trust or pleasure or pride an erotic lisa who would smile forever and could never know why the of the were more complex than those of kitchen model but the unstop tab could free did one of three would happen likely she would be meat there is reason why are most often used in likely she would live the rest of her days with mind as free of worry as slug the chance of all she would blink as if had just in emil bedroom and then she would laugh and tell me that she was going to be immortal as put my hand on the impervious surface of run for the door is strange to know that we can do of kindness to those we should hate this my future self to us emil name will live as long as his masterpiece could say that did not dare to take responsibility for her fate could say that chose out of consideration for her desire for fame some already say is work science way to safely free the of emil art perhaps the who this file will know that my decision is wise cannot stop thinking that was never afraid of losing to brain damage or death fear is that she would live and would learn that had lost her long before emil her into thing that can be kept admired and for in my way have done the same thing am ready for the now california is vibration as mechanical wave through medium and in space there is no medium when my shuttle and the keep the air in nothing the first whoosh of the air being away there was lightning but no thunder in panic but no and peaceful right relief to never again hear my jesse natter about his girl back on and that all vacation for two she won last time he was on leave swore if ever had to see photo of him in skimpy bathing suit again giving the camera cheesy up from lounge chair on one of those white sandy kiss monkey of course before all the air is out of the ship person is so lucky to have stuffed him or herself into space suit that person less than twenty four to live is more than the person would have sans space suit found space suit but it was statistically unlikely that and whomever else suit pun intended would manage to repair our ship before the less than twenty four are up yes have been done twenty four or take the time was my last in my head trying not to think too much about what suffocating felt like that when bell first thought was going crazy four of silence vacuum remember was now it again was fine bell reminiscent of ancient stone and the towering seen in the bell saw light there were two here that made ridiculously small of sense the whole in vacuum why there bell thing was floating in the dark of my broken ship and any conceivable light were not within view starlight is distinctly different color and significantly less bright were the of my the first they said to me meant nothing listening care was going to live was going to keep breathing to those nothing else the air tasted sweet in my mouth and all that crossed my mind were cheap about life giving and how breathing was like sex only better reserved the right to revise this opinion later was done mentally exclaiming over my impossible rescue around the ship it was odd and old either so outdated or so heavily that tell what make it was and somehow the crew standing around me fit the same description singularly atypical amalgamation of folk me guess was one more piece in their puzzle was one more scrap to weld onto the rest one more survivor who was found was now one of them story it our story the of the unfortunate the catastrophic the fateful this is us alone each of us facing the silence of the vacuum we were found found we can never be lost is our california can never leave on ship now do this lot woman as and neither tall nor beautiful and then about my you save them as much as jesse had me like the picture my brain drew of him floating in his grave body swollen and bloated would tell his girl how he had said the captain he himself clean shaven and smart picture of the perfect entrepreneur opportunist and businessman that was re selective about our he continued fit the bill she at the captain and her greasy brown over her shoulder turned to me on she said before could say anything else let get you settled in no time for no time for the ship had all the usual artificial gravity tastefully painted sound to keep the noise of the from driving the crew insane air and few less usual lush carpeting lighting that was decorative as well as functional spacious the occasional painting hung on the wall generic and of old people no one ever met primarily of elegant down the branching music the aroma of real food was heaven no seventy two but it would do are we going back your quarters not far you re not going to get no meant where the ship going our destination she stopped walking gave me look pitying and little that she got to be the one to share the news she said re going to be delighted everywhere nowhere was hell in those last suffocating on my own breath and this this was my reward the speed of sound in dry air at twenty celsius or sixty eight fahrenheit is three hundred and forty three per second or one thousand one hundred twenty five per second took me couple days to realize was in fact still alive mean sure had my moment of elation when had first been but it sink in watching my ship tear apart after spending good twenty three floating in silence in the wreck wondering whether was currently facing belonging to the constellation libra or the constellation orion when those were from wondering what it felt like to suffocate and after the feeling that yes was in fact going to die alone in space had sunk in it took time for that feeling to dissipate dead this left my quarters the provided had informed me when and where official were taking place but to acknowledge the relevant somehow given that was still over the explosion the of my and the rescue there are number of of grief and shock guess was working my way through them was to my quarters figure out any be sent someone must have left and was nice enough to send food my way the bottle of wine was nice touch must have it too because later on the and the bottle were both empty spent lot of time lying on my back on the bed staring up at the little in the ceiling or in the old fashioned armchair staring out the at the did lot of staring and not moving was it good to be done with that stage was time to find out what hell like is other people the ship was spacious pick up many the select special few scattered here and there between the we were all on this ship and we were on it together form in any decent sized group of people was singled out by sarah an unassuming forty something lady with glass of champagne in one hand and the arm of scrawny but tall man in the other up to me as was scooping little round crackers and what to be baked cream dip onto plate the plate by the way was already loaded with folded of smoked pink fish paprika deviled through green and of cheese and of meat smothered in tomato based sauce even to the fare one would find in the high class space and pleasure to what mere engineer would get on your typical cargo ship it was lip smackingly gorgeous if the food to my quarters the past few days had been similarly amazing decided it have been the taste of the sweet life eh sarah and this is must be the new pickup me over approvingly on let get you glass of champagne longingly at the of olive bread as she me over to the bar but protest the bar was by an expensive humanoid robot turned toward sarah wave and acknowledged her with nod later setting fluted glass of sparkling liquid in front of her at the robot smoothness and it was high end model sarah transferred the glass to my free hand and me away from the bar for more with alexis trailing after us spent the evening listening mostly and stuffing my face with all the of fine food provided no one minded sarah inner circle was content to fill our circle of with plenty of chatter ray plump man who was grey where he bald short and dark and lean with very intense gaze made me little uncomfortable petite her hair strung out in series of that nearly to her waist them based on their be able to pick them out of the crowd again later of their chatter was meaningless to of day to day how so and so had been seen in so and so table at lunch and my that surprise and why the chef this delectable selection of for the dance the other night but of course those rolled meat one of the back on they and this was somehow an interesting fact the first half hour stopped effort to keep and and gossip straight learning anything useful could have but to get my first was for observation bother trying to seek out different group of potentially more interesting people though all the same of social surrounded by the less apt the on the circle with whom the gossip was at the ship instead the fine food and the ornamental lighting it had to be exorbitantly to maintain the was any indication suspected similarly high class other on the ship they were all powered was good as the technology got quality robot like that was still an energy sink was the brain mostly the amount of information the machine had to process to be able to function at the level it did ate up lot of sarah crowd took turns taking my champagne flute to the bar to be all seemingly to have new set of to talk at slowly returned my attention to the conversation and was pleasantly to find that it had turned to analysis of recent abstract in the style of old had seen during off time at the end of the evening when finally the slow trickle of people out of the room satisfying haze had settled on my mind was nice decided ship life the nagging about where the ship had come from and what its purpose in me was still but somehow less urgent it truly matter what the ship origin was and why had saved me if now was content easy to fall into would wake late the clock on my room to make sure slept through brunch would join the rest of the ship for and would take my turn in the weight room would watch old on the entertainment taking mental for later dinnertime would immerse myself in new virtual reality would attend afternoon dance classes so that when the evening came around after the historical social of several hundred prior would be less of an embarrassment to myself did not ask told myself should told myself that tonight the observation period would end and start puzzling out the ship mystery fell under the ship sway of my previous familiar life onto and ray and and sarah with alexis dragged along on her arm now and then he was mostly her favorite dancing partner she to us one night that his conversational left something to be desired smothered of back on was my long vacation my clean break and my temporary retreat try those tomorrow continued to care little for gossip but our of and old and new brought out my artistic story loving argumentative side side of me into back storage compartment during my as an engineer was good life if sure the dream stage to end are timeless but tell if it had been or since was there was all was blur for in the dress up with all the fine clothes found in the some of it modern some of it period dress for special in the and then new face in the crowd washed out fading into the backdrop of and fake glass and the hum of the of these we were in the south for post dinner lounging on and watching other of our populace move in on the dance floor the south was in the title to suggest that there were more sarah circle had picked up another newcomer adrienne short girl who we all agreed was barely old enough to attend traditional university back on let alone work on the ship in whose wreck had found her it was her curiosity question should have long before that turned the conversation serious maybe there was just something special about that evening we had all tired of the frivolity of our life some threshold or some breaking point when adrienne what the ship purpose was we all gave it measure of thought up half and inchoate tossing these out the same way we about the art believe we see the end of the universe said cohort she had glass of orange brown liquid in one hand it might have been orange juice and some kind of berry liquor it speculatively watched adrienne her head listening not speaking said sitting in the chair to her left can live that long the universe will end sooner than you think said the captain was there with the rest of us drink but he made point of with all the various we travel at the speed of light and we won age said sarah setting her wine glass on the little round end table by her couch we re already traveling at the speed of light she eagerly it all impossible if we were traveling at ninety nine percent of the speed of assuming you ignore science and pretend that such thing is possible because it still age just appear to age than people not traveling as fast as us said sarah is relative anyway mind being around forever our purpose their alive hypothesis slipping into the conversation no one immortal fact the opposite re all going to die like it at sarah who ray took drink from his glass of ice water and shook his head re all going to die so what better thing to do than enjoy the time we have to the bar the the the money can buy took drink thinking the money can buy she skeptical for how of fact amused think about it continued where else would we get the money to buy all this what our cargo eh captain leaning back in his chair with his glass of wine shook his head and stood up leave you to your speculation he said chorus of good nights him out the door the captain left in set his glass down on an end table steepled his together re revolting he told us don mean that you disgust me no we re the start of rebellion you hear what the captain said we re going to change the future the universe as we know it won be the same dumb said sarah we know it if we were part of rebellion shook his head the captain selected us for reason inside else would he know where to find us about us still dumb said sarah intelligence don you remember there not exactly one big galactic government from which to steal information still like my idea said adrienne example and speak up to myself to stay safely in gather observation mode though thought had point share how he found people share how he knew exactly where the were or why he saved some people but not then again no one guess we all figured he knew what he was doing had been at this savior business longer than any of us if adrienne would ask about that re going to mean something was saying we do against the oppression of the many that oppose us we re going to leave legacy certain even ray he shook his head and broke the quiet he most of the evening got it all wrong from sarah to adrienne to to and to me we can last longer than the rest of the universe giving anyone purpose re not even going to leave legacy we re doing is we re doing is eating and drinking and breathing and and nothing important ever special bleak adrienne for him to be quiet forward setting her on the foot stool in front of her never know when it will end ray continued not any one of us in particular can hold on forever even if you don ever ever want to forget long until the slip away long until all you remember is this the ship the thick red carpeting the the empty you hold with the other who used to be people your life the reason you lived the people and and the you felt who and what you when all that is gone faded what will you have left how long ray had been on this ship why if he had such an unpropitious outlook he tried to change his situation to ask but he was still talking and was too self conscious to interrupt can try to hold on said ray can try and try and try to yourself in the artificial night sketch in your mind can make their your mantra if you repeat them enough times lose their meaning emily em ill em lee eh mill eh lee wife name once it enough times it just sound no longer grounded ray he said we last forever if our are the last watching as the blink out it won mean thing to us won care that we re last and we won care that there are no more re just dumb and lucky dumb luck he said nerve huh said said ray long ago was that adrienne your wife mean on this ship ray he down at his folded together in his lap interlaced don know he said were all quiet for moment ray then got up and left let him go conscious were made and after few only adrienne and were left sitting in the ballroom across the circle of at me your theory she me long have you been here that long said couple guess month or two don you know for sure she been counting days did you do before this were you found was an engineer how my ship had no warning at all the the impossible rescue don know how knew to find me there the ship was on guess that what too vital part broke and well boom was all so fast took sip of her drink plain water because she had she had never the taste of alcohol then fixed her gaze on me going to figure it out she said and why this ship figure it out then going to find way home paced my room that night unable to sleep the more thought about it the less sense the ship made adrienne had made this clear to me with single question had spent nothing contentedly getting nowhere adrienne me too easy to fall into resolved to break the pattern evening another room another swirl of and and circle of and another uncomfortable question anyone ever left adrienne at each of us in turn ray glance with sarah that you mention it haven seen alexis in days assumed he was indisposed in agreement at ray and raised an eyebrow ray said slowly do leave the approximate number of people at any given event is always the same we see new re sure it not just some people being indisposed adrienne sarah phrasing shook his head and picked up handful of candied from little dish on the end table people long enough regardless you get more overall couple people in their even if you switch out the people won make difference the back into the dish one by one where do they go adrienne on cut in better question is does anyone ever come back ray and another glance her lip sarah and at her drink moment ray said don think so there adrienne leaves there was an uncomfortable moment of silence guess don notice do you sarah indignant course we notice well no one important ever so it really matter does it could tell she was trying to remember whom she had known who had left and failing no one her no one different answer at adrienne accomplished routine insouciance had been the scales had tipped when the conversation returned to lighter as it soon did dwelt on adrienne the on my knew they were thinking the same long have you been here the question previously to me was to the rest of our group excluding ray adrienne had been tactful enough to wait until he had gone for refill the last time the subject was sarah she her head and finger on the side of her wine glass long time to be and at least were here before was said and so was at he in weird way here kept track for eight after that guess see the point are timeless not adrienne don matter he said the eleventh of month or the seventeenth whether it wednesday or sunday summer back on or winter it affect us here but spoke before the other woman could are you so interested she adrienne adrienne met her gaze don want to be here forever we re not here forever sarah alexis left corrected her don know how or why he left where he went thoughtful picked up his glass the liquid around took sip then set the glass back down around at the rest of us you want to leave he you live anywhere else now spoke up said miss this much no one else said anything watched adrienne move from one face to the next he me again leaning forward with his on his and an intense steady gaze think that he said but is it true you be happy back in normal life working and living and crying in the drudgery of whatever the hell normal is these days answer too easy to fall into sure the dream stage to end quarters felt stifling my mind sat sideways in the armchair dangling over one arm neck resting against the other absently tracing invisible between the outside my window as on the situation the had proved singularly unhelpful the of entertainment old style engrossing and action selection of quondam and few recently to gain popularity was schedule advertising upcoming on ship such as dance classes craft sessions and discussion and list of dinner for me to respond to menu of display me to all the superficial simple contact system for communicating with other people on the ship was all methodical search of my two adjoining the ample closet space and the attached bathroom facility had similarly provided no fodder dark wood expensive polished no secret clothes leftover tray of half food from the previous day lunch complete with miniature of sweet smelling apricot honey lotion me was and to prove to adrienne that solve the ship mystery just as much as she did to find something anything that would prove all this was normal and sane want to think about and time and and my contentment back cornered adrienne at dinner that night one hand balanced my plate of star shaped crackers of elegant and little rolled of and through with of some pale green plant and an array of other delectable bite sized other hand pointedly adrienne to small table against wall at me but obediently let me pull her along me said after we sat what you have found question gave me grumpy look that informed me quite clearly of her current opinion of me if you re going to be rude about it not really but lie to get the conversation going want to know in two brief my impasse don know much she said still but at least the information from our previous dinner the captain say something yesterday as walking to the was just coming up on corner and he was around the other side talking to couple people and they must not have known was there said something about wreck going well listen when they came round the corner ray was with the captain the next time the captain stopped by our group along that she too was social butterfly who could mingle equally well with everyone we were ready there doctor on board adrienne been was lie but we information past the second door on the left robot then were even more expensive than the how many people it anyone on the ship ever fallen seriously ill he age adrienne the captain never thought about it adrienne steepled her and studied my face answer my question she said adrienne only picked at her food hungry sympathetically no said adrienne least have drink said sarah find it the edge off drink remember said that the problem said sarah hundred and forty seven is magic number said sarah ever of we got the perfect size group right here enough for us all to recognize each other enough for us all to be able to barely avoid killing each other anyone mutiny adrienne you dislike this place so much why don you do something about it can said ray would we do adrienne shook her head and made sound of disgust could force the captain to set down somewhere us off the ship he threaten him he still well of all of us there someone who can drive ship murder sarah survival adrienne corrected her you want to be stuck here for the rest of your life sarah reply my in the plush green carpeting of the looking out the at the like that running on less sleep than should alone because everyone else had had the sense to retire for the night had tendency to get all meditative about the universe and my place in it the stillness of the room as did the view and more black speckled by tiny of light that up to break the emptiness if only for brief time of it was temporary save for the black was tonight melodramatic theme the ephemeral nature of life temporary to fade away lost as dust and scattered between the and every one of us to be left as alone as the moment we were born about that if sarah theory was right after all in this world we have to make them permanent ourselves he had done that had made us constant made this constant the one thing that was known the one thing that change everything we did all the we told maybe it was all we never know each other not truly because we all behind the the we to see ultimately this ship its purpose our it matter each had our own theory that was enough all of us we were permanent in each that made us more real it made us feel less alone if join you turned to see adrienne in the doorway then crossed the room to join me by the window not waiting for an answer nights said can see the meaning in any of it these do they re just to pass the time until die adrienne at me then back out through the window don see meaning because there is no meaning she said all of it as much as we feared being alone we feared being vulnerable even more instinct was to hide what found adrienne said her was bottle what to adrienne find her was in the is vibration the speed of sound in dry air at twenty celsius or sixty eight fahrenheit is three hundred and forty three per second or one thousand one hundred twenty five per second his dosage the captain say got replacement lined up ran want to forget want to be the last thing remember was tearing down the thought ship had life case of emergency break glass find one put on space suit get out of this ship find civilization again planet space station other ship place but this place all else suffocate ray he caught me as on the corridor finding no glass to break he told me sliding needle into my arm pass he told me me in his arms until stopped is my california can never leave stood stock still waiting for the first tiny gleam from the scout craft to appear in the darkness of the wormhole the gentle constant breeze of air from the vent above an annoying hair against her nose but she it gasp from the psychic broke her silent vigil and she turned harmon she suppressed the surge of annoyance that ran through her as she the psi gift of getting all the hot news first harmon face slowly animated joy sweeping in to replace stern concentration the planet with life large and small no of any kind and stable atmosphere not even them back through for face to face briefing we should come through now immediately before the probe is late harmon tell that good for nothing son of beta to get his through the gate and back here or open fire on him when we come back through all the impertinence no doubt with from mason was her command what get for not returned to her watch regarding her own reflection in the long window black curly hair cut short in the typical military style framed careworn dark skinned face was not an attractive face right now her ebony shadowed by on the watch full pursed with frustration had the look of every leader she had ever known six foot two she stood full head taller than even her first officer glowering expression the imposing effect picked imaginary off her stark gray and look like hell don blow this don let fatigue get to you used the discretion of the mirrored window to secretively survey her crew harmon was an excellent addition to the bridge team but was she open minded enough to defy and sever all from watched the psi bob her head unaware of the rest of the bridge shaking blonde as she away with the approaching psi relay on mason ship so depthless self conscious and shallow on the outside but that incredible gift had to be more to her if she pan out she be crew member that would jeopardize the project was meat would be shame to lose that talent though her first officer was staring pensively at his panel was what this was all about watched his graceful ending in thick black tap out on the panel pointed swiveled back and forth catching every sound from the bridge while his long tail to the rhythm of his those of the inner team knew he was no common beta furry silken fur which would be tawny golden and striped with jet black was perfectly to pure black and his mane and as to be indistinguishable from the rest of his coat had been and to rich purple to disguise the brilliant golden yellow color that would mark him as an and leader of his hive now he like an overgrown wolf who learned touch the scout ship re from the hole brilliant speck from sphere of velvety blackness hail crackled across the and spun to retake her seat at the helm the second probe be crushed to learn that another gateway little more than class planet and white dwarf system and should prepare to be and move out like it the one the distinctive whuffle of pleasure through the on the bridge and let loose small growl as if to caution his against false hope twenty seven so far and none had turned up anything worth the time would not let giddy drag them onto rock that would spell the end for the project and the species foster to neil and sabbath have always to my family came in through my mother blood my russian grandmother would always tell me of with the second sight stupid mill who discovered of gold after special fish off their and dark who used to appear to help or interfere at crucial times her if she ever seen them before was old enough to stop believing mean she would always look sad and tell me no not since the family came to america anything to us if you ever should see faerie tell him that you are of the blood of ivan and he will not pass you by so quickly as got older shook the tales off with nod and nana got older and went to school then to college and the my nana gave me with the music mixed for in of pulse that shook us until we could believe anything rachel and would go to the our school we get word that people were gathering under one of the and we rush down to hit it before the broke it up boston is strange place at night believe half of the seen even when was straight was friday night rachel and went out to dinner and when we finished she saw that there was message on her cell phone checked it there in the restaurant head into the phone as she her purse on her lap shining jet against the worn black of her snug shirt from mitch she said folding up the phone we should meet him tonight theres good one going on in that church that closed down last month dont know it was going to be just us tonight not sure up for night out was feeling calm and private that night like darkness was small and personal cupped offering place for two not the burning open darkness of rave go been over week and want to dance go together you know have fun once you get into it bit the inside of her bottom lip looking at me like was breaking her poor sweet heart sucker for that and she it rachel go probably right and gave me kiss across the table her soft and firm and sticking just enough that she gave the feeling you were really kissing not just pressing your face into someone not get up tonight though dont babe on dont have to get up every time we go out just to enjoy myself not waste any more time stood up and her out to the street was dark enough that could actually see few through the screen of city light hearing the car could almost taste the air of late march through the street it was march that meant that wed been together almost year and half was last february after the winter break that we in together spring was back under the concrete and could smell it even here it an amazing night the city alive when spring comes waved down car and me in few we were getting out block down from the abandoned church she the driver she my arm laughing and we ran down the street the pulse already against the doorway and was laughing too the pulse close enough to shake the doorframe and set up in my chest rachel in my arms because shed used me to soften her landing and slipped inside the old vaulted church was stripped down there was no cloth on the altar just and his beer the dark could see three left in the wall from where taken down the crucifix confessional too beaten up to have been sold was shaking in way that activity inside and where the had been taken out couple hundred people were to the moving sermon rachel stepped forward into the crowd while took moment to drink in the blue lit shadowed vault and the light catching haze from who what rising between the and the crowd was terrific echo each beat inside of the next and the old glass rattled in their the dance floor people with their closed and their in the air with rachel for while but then something by the bar to be her told me that she was heading for drink and slipped out of the crowd she come back halfway through the next song over at the bar was just little set up where someone had few and brought something alcoholic to share mostly beer rachel was standing with plastic cup looking like she was conversation but see anyone else there the next time the crowd split saw him stood in front of blue light so see him clearly but what saw was memorable wore jacket of what might have been blue velvet and his hair black against his white skin the blue haze to stop just shy of his pallor setting off his striking face without illuminating its and his white in the darkness didnt move just and his drink the next time saw them his mouth was moving and he took her arm watched them through the crush of as they along the wall and the feeling came to me that something was very wrong saturday morning woke up and saw that she still come home mitch and our other that shed at one of their but had no luck couple of them seeing her leave but none of them had seen the thin man with her didnt know how they could miss such exotic even in that light caught taxi back to the church was still mess but everything bigger than soda can had across what had been the dance floor the church was completely different now sunlight fell through the glass catching dust that still hung in the air and sending dry healthy warmth into the of the room through the stone and the powdery concrete that had been covered last night by flesh and flashing that rachel had without leaving clue and had no way to do anything but wait for her to show up which if she were in situation where should be doing something would probably be never in the center of the church took out my cell phone and the police need to file missing report rachel night walking on street around maybe eleven or twelve oclock sir this is an unusual situation didnt come home last night none of her have seen her sir if in any danger it will probably be too late to help her by that time dont even know where to start looking and need help sir understand the police wouldnt file report for someone been missing overnight closed the phone out of the church little gust of cold air caught me by surprise cold front must have hit while was inside down the street that didnt have friend to drive me home this time and it was long walk back to the streets where taxis ran my down my arms as far as go but wasnt ready for cold didnt build up much heat it just the air enough to chill me more about block car rolled up behind me down as it me and to worry wasnt the best of kept my straight ahead and tried to walk more quickly without showing it an automatic window roll down said male voice do you need some help turned around the man over forty and he was driving car be afraid to drive on this street long way to anywhere worth going he said you like some help ah think fine thanks told him and turned back to the sidewalk like to help hop in dont look dressed for this weather back over my shoulder no thanks sir just fine dont worry about me nathan spencer offer you help advise that you not refuse me third time stopped and back at him met my coolly do you know my name know your family in have lot of work ahead of us and its best to start now around the car and got into the passenger seat had my belt on we were rolling forward said in the car will you tell me how you know my family and how you to be driving by just now fact why didnt you call me by name the first time how did you recognize me when enough can only answer one question at time know your family because an ancestor of mine made bargain with an ancestor of yours am here now because you for help and no one else would answer turned onto the next street and up will help you find your rachel have to warn you though you wont like what have to tell you in his tone be me anyway in trouble want to find her wherever she is driver took deep breath as he did his neck in strange way and several thin like running across the sides of his neck nathan he in the way that people speak when they start long and difficult explanation rachel met someone last night whom it is best never to meet person like me is not member of traditional society see nathan there is separate from your society oh damn it never had to give this conversation before on have something to show you that he made sharp turn onto side street that before drove between slummy housing and so decayed that tell whether they were abandoned driver turned again next to an old warehouse that might have been in once when mitch took us to rave in sophomore year front of few there were but there were almost none on the streets ready to drop off and their paint was half smog got strange feeling that we werent supposed to be driving here said are you sure that we should be going this way mean ignore that he told me be used to the sensation in moment just unnerved me more as we kept driving the anxiety grew more pronounced that there were some people on the street people the same color as the soiled standing just in the lip of an alley at me with gleaming this is the spot said my driver over and got out it really safe to leave the car he was already walking toward the squat brick building we were next to back at that gleaming glare decided that it might be to follow the driver than to wait with the car hopped out ran after him and him just as he was knocking on the door it crack then us in the building up the ceiling was high and wooden and could see part of booth down the hall like we were in the back of down and saw what had let us in my man up the hunchbacked being who let us in out scraggly paw for him to slap nice my man he said as they the freak is someone from family ever tell you about them one time man but you were pretty up your problem the hunchbacked man came up to my stomach skin was brown and like some diseased bark back around his which bore that might have been or he saw that his teeth were sharp and small like hunting matted hair his had slit quickly for me came down here with someone after party and dont think it was one of your average whats the cat look like turned to me you can trust him why we came here was easier to talk than to question him from across the room when was looking around for rachel was standing right in front of some blue so see him very well but the way that the light set off his pale skin almost like the light bent around him without actually touching him directly was slim almost drawn but he had kind of luster to him guess wasnt person youd describe with normal you know totally said the hunchback get that all the time around here was wearing sort of jacket maybe blue velvet tell in the dark but it had at the throat like that really stood out why understand why no one else him had some too remember that he hardly ever just at rachel when he he hardly his mouth dont know how he been over the music the two at each other do you think the hunchback into it little and do think we might be dealing with one of them you seen anyone like that in your club that can remember man can send you to guy who all about them though this for real bet my friend can tell you everything you need to know wonder should head straight over wont be long before nightfall yeah man let me write down how to find him the hunchback out scrap of paper and scribbled something on it with his fingernail then handed it to you go man luck owe you one go last one was to me waved to the hunchback as we left gave me half hearted wave that made me wonder what exactly we were chasing and whether should be wearing body armor on the street to see that had never for until then in my initial shock suddenly of the people that my mind registered when we saw people with skin so tightly across their that the had broken through people whose had growing from them and people whose skin was back like the yellow of this sky wasnt just smog it had heavy dimness saw men three tall with dusty black skin and that shed yellow light corpulent batrachian woman along with something on leash that like massive water beetle from the rough hewn window of one building on our right was something with long green hair across the seven gangly arms hanging from its five thin waved lazily like seaweed when my back hit the wall that was walking backwards and like us have been living separately as long as there been human society said my driver that the on his neck expanded as he breathed and that they were interact with take advantage of them grant them sometimes even become their but the majority of both have little or no interaction this point we have removed ourselves so fully from quotidian human existence that we are understood to be fictional the only place with any significant interaction between our is on the of yours where society is put on hold and open themselves to emotion that is where from this world tend to go when they cross over and that is where rachel met someone from this world those of us who live permanently in this world tend to set up in like this where the human population is so overwhelming that they wont be in the right corner with the right protective took out the and at an alley behind us nathan should get right away no time to waste saw that wasnt moving an arm on my shoulder he said nathan what you see here might be frightening but those you saw are people just like you be as to see human as you are to see men with seven arms very reassuring that not only be an outsider but curiosity nathan you told me five ago that you would do anything to help rachel here and she needs your help the more we can do before nightfall the better why are you even helping me thirty ago didnt believe in magic or any of that kind of weirdness nathan told you my family yours debt this world word is promise can we get going caught my breath and forced myself to look him in the eye if you stop beginning every sentence with my name got deal go as we headed down the sidewalk said is your name anyway question you learn not to ask here you may call me is took us around the corner of the building into skinny alleyway wondering again how reliable my were through an alley with rubbish piles that occasionally from one wall to the other he did not inspire confidence at this corner he said interrupting my immanent panic attack were going to stop and turn three times er counterclockwise then face east is that way pointed at the wall to our right let the sun fool you going to shed little blood but dont worry none of yours blinked at him but he just kept walking until we the corner you might feel silly but just turn three times to your left to keep in time with me spun around three times and then something across hand and he shook spray of blood onto the dust the blood into as soon as it hit the ground and back it had all burnt thin outline of doorframe on the wall across from our corner towards it and his bloody palm against it opening the door you coming slipped through the door and came out not inside the building but on busy street in completely different part of town the sky cupping over squat was less yellow here and were set up everywhere the way picture market in the took us immediately to the right where he led us to cart filled with air hanging around the cart carried tarragon rosemary and place the thing tending the cart me of the caterpillar from alice in it had the same opium dream wise man quality always given the caterpillar arms were thin and long enough to reach any from its cushion in the center of the cart and with its long many shouldered pole of torso it rose over our even while seated face was small and wrinkled with penny sized smoked glasses balanced on its thin nose the care to purchase some fine it are no finer to spice meal nor purer to mix potion let yourselves breathe the fine scent of these not here to browse told him like to see man about some garlic the thing have many fine of garlic here on the cart gentle sir know what mean if we could see him we would be much obliged imagine that people do not come here for unimportant thoughtfully true behind the cart and enter through the door there your left hand to open the door and your right he at me to close it you bowed slightly and we behind the cart the latch under left hand with clack the door took us to the bottom of flight of wooden the top was one door the room bed bookcase and desk with one chair only light came from dying candle on the desk whose spark in the roughly the bed was small ratty man smelled matted hair and cedar chips one eye when we came in but did not move here for information about vampire said said you do us the kindness of helping us to identify an individual you said nothing about dont know if we can even doing anything against vampire an entire industry in my world based around how unkillable they are look are they as bad as people in my world think they are dont know almost as rare here and never reliable story of someone successfully fighting vampire unsuccessfully right no those people dont usually leave thanks for your confidence inspiring tales of experience theyre probably worse than we think thats great can you tell me what your master plan of attack will be before we go spinning counterclockwise into an anne novel plan is that you shut up while were trying to conduct business with someone who might be able to tell us what were actually going up against forget your calm down while talk to this gentleman can hear your heartbeat from over here shut up and tried to breathe turned back to the little man on the bed who had not accept our as you can see our situation is of personal importance to the young man may we ask you few about an individual we believe to be vampire would be great help to us the little man drew few loud that in the wooden tight air in pinched rasp he said information is purely for the of collector do not want to provide help to someone who would do harm sir we simply want to discover whether this individual is in fact vampire there is any boon that you would have us do in return we would be glad to do it continued to lie in place still breathing heavily tried to keep myself calm with sigh he said have need of certain stone that once possessed would allow me to leave this bed despite my current illness problem is that it was not made in this realm but by human and only human may handle it the herb vendor will tell you where you can find it you would fetch me this stone would tell you what can course we will fetch you the stone assured him have our thanks the thing at the herb cart when we the stone told the name of woman who lived on certain street and we set off we the street some sort of temple or row of or at least sleazy black market merchant it like we were in the red light district who probably more than our money eyed us from the didnt need to warn me not to speak to them took us to the door of building like short pagoda that had sign hanging over it showing face with uplifted like saint under light and the entrance room was hung with bright and scattered with velvet of obscene orange and green that springtime hung across that might have been sensual elsewhere but here were only offensive large woman similarly decorated quickly up to us evening she said may invite you to have cup of tea no thank you said we regret that we cannot take up your kind offer you the proprietor of this shop the woman am at your service can help you are here to see about certain stone raised an eyebrow you we dont get many about that item walk this way led us past the and through an arch decorated with of wooden and what like african the next room had of what could have been rome with men in simple working in vineyard on one wall and men in odd floppy on the other this we went up flight of and past row of barred on the outside me said warning look but may ask what is kept in these the woman the merchandise of course she said close to my ear is slave shop he quietly the woman before another door this one not barred but locked as she brought out the key she said deal mostly in fairly mundane but there are few with more unusual needs and people willing to sell unusual had indentured even and the occasional elf is one of the stranger though been in our collection for several because only human can activate it we only had human on our staff we could have done so ago and sold it off but we have no such luck the door and took us past several marked with odd geometrical to another locked room it is she said flourish she the door to reveal room with inlaid with and gold wire intricate like jewelry crawling down the its center under spearing white light was golden table with blue velvet cloth on which lay gray plum sized rock marvel it she said such rock could hold so much magic its wonder it is assured her would convince you to part with it considered this looking him over wouldnt give me the human would you no she said seeing his expression that would make the stone rather useless she gave me what can only describe as an appraising glance have never felt so in all my life healthy she said how about pint of his blood pint have his health to consider pint then and his hair turned to me what do you think this is your quest not giving my blood as if it interrupted the woman think its fair deal considering the return he told me but its up to you thought about it then cried the woman half pint of human blood willingly given and his fine head of hair for the stone took us downstairs to small room behind red silk was wooden chair where she sat me down and me to wait she came back with lidded ceramic bowl which she put on the table beside me up your she told me the bowl and carefully gingerly brought out fat dripping leech must have been than my finger laid it gently inside the hollow of my left arm the cold thing and cast around with its sucker mouth until it found the soft spot inside my elbow where it softly on and to work its way under my skin thought that could feel slight itching take about quarter pint each said drawing out another skinny leech quick too be done with them before your hair is finished she clapped her and brought in the barber an hour later left the room pale and bald running my over my scalp least the barber me took me back up to the room where was waiting by the door careful you dont let him touch it until ready to use it the woman as she slipped the stone into grey cloth pouch and handed it to him you for doing business at our house and hope to see you again left not little unnerved and still woozy from the leeches on said you could use drink hit bar on the next street over straight up told the bartender as we sat down at the counter and mary for my friend it extra bloody our came he dollop of something from an inner pocket into my mary should help he said could run on empty with little of that stuff wont refill your blood supply but while thats in your system you wont even need blood at me up took about half of the mary in one gulp and then ate the celery me on the back said now that were sitting down can you explain little more of whats going on here mean what is this place really thought about that think that our world is reflection of yours or yours is more boring reflection of ours place is just little of both america are still weird after the european conquest the are still here but so is everyone else the mostly manifest as something like the underground society of your arent quite what youd expect from reading the do you mean take elves caught the eye for another shot figure theyre some lincoln green pretty who run around in the forest with and live forever in of glory right in america theyre the snotty rich who show up in because they like the gritty ambience you have them in your world too right its worse here because they have to grow disaffected and flirt with exciting and dangerous of of them actually commit to this society though an amazing an elf real ear for it they do decide to do something for real theyre always the best at it the second shot am glad to be out of the favor trading scene for half minute exhausting to talk to those people wrong word and you find yourself cursed with infinite earwax or something what else do you want to know nathan dont know hey what about the nature like that mean where do the fit in place like this the tree around the dryad around as simple as that made me little sad were always my favorite part of the greek read in elementary school what about you did you get to america came over from russia just like your family real name is little more ethnically appropriate but we dont toss those around in this place were of certain branch of the and the village based around mill on that tributary the russian government the river my decided that instead of dying with the river they would stick with the people of the village was born here and was lucky enough not to get attached to any particular river miss place to settle down but its better than waiting to get took another shot of vodka you be going light on the vodka mean we might have lot of work ahead of us you can drink like fish should get going though woozy little walking should get the stuff into your system on go as we left the bar to see the rock just curious want to see what magic stone like worry be careful not to touch it thought about it then handed me the pouch undid the and let the pouch sit on my palm so that could see the stone inside like normal river stone gray oval with white stripe through it as long as at it it didnt reveal any magic sparkle or glow what like little out of an alley and almost ran into me almost over him and the stone went flying out of the pouch tried to grab it but by reflex caught it first felt it grow warm and knew that had done something very stupid nathan said think that you just did something very stupid agree told him the stone was as warm as human flesh now and there was sort of glow that might have been light or just the soft heat dont know there was light kind of rosy glow and felt the stone slip out of my hand to float in the air the air around me to still sound and light came in around the of my you know what this thing does hardly able to hear myself was saying something that like have no idea but hear him the light in the of my rushed in converging on the rosy glow around the stone and for moment was blind my again and saw girl lying in the street was no sign of the stone think understand why we got that stone from slave shop said the girl was as soft and rosy as the glow and she was dressed in white shift tied at the waist with belt like celtic knot arms and were wrapped in white linen up to her and and soft white leather boots her she didnt move knelt down and put hand to her brow as soon as touched her her into mine and she my wrist move me she said my mouth to ask for an explanation but stopped me name her did you say the next thing that comes out of your mouth is probably what shell respond to until we figure out how to put her back was at loss never anyone before thought back to one time when been thinking about raising family and that always the name amy at me incredulously awaken magical being of unknown power from an stone her with your own blood from slave dealer and you name her amy amy at me and let go of my arm but not before she brought my to her and gave them one soft kiss stood up and amy stood with me back to our garlicky friend suppose so said and youd better pray to whatever god you think will listen that he wont care we woke her up back to the herb stand the vendor little at amy his arms in as he lit the little lamp but we right around him and up the wooden the little door he rolled over and to see us but when amy in he he woke it up out of my sight this instant but sir said are you sure no help to you if you it already you ninny and sure that you have out of my sight now unless you know how to put it back thought as much leave before call the on you left shook his at me like he to wrap them around my neck idiot he do you know how much youve set us back should say set yourself back since its your were looking for thought about rachel in the excitement had forgotten why we were chasing down vampire just lucky that my only contact on were heading out the door for me and amy when we the bottom of the outside was to see that it was already dark comes quickly here said quietly as he came out behind me warn you he said as we hit the street were going to see another friend of mine though we are getting you hat look ridiculous with shaved head nearby stand he the first hat that would cover my head and might pass back in real boston was black baseball cap that read in gold across the front amy it think still spoken since her so wasnt sure took us to squat long building whose roof up like the of animal the black door as we came up to it and pale man the door was naked but there was nothing to hide his body was hairless and completely smooth only say he because he didnt have hint of femininity were white behind him could hear something that like remix of the here to see isis her that is here to see her the man closed his moment later he them again and stepped aside to let us in straight past him and tried to keep up taking small hand so that she wouldnt lag behind as past the pale blank wondering what they were staring at amy gave my hand squeeze lead us down hallway that the vaulted ribbed intestine of hallway whose black organic thought that saw one rib shift in its setting like cat trying to scratch its back against wall but when turned it was still there was door which as we the space into wide square chamber mirrored and so dark that it could have been any size the center was dais covered with white and young woman surrounded by more pale men were incontestably male said the woman slithering up across the to sit up as she rose her fell open and that except for what like red silk kimono she was naked naked and stunning had an urge to cover been since seen you come and sit beside me and introduce your man is here in search of his lover who was stolen from him in the human world said us toward the woman in silk the girl is surprising he am isis said the woman offering her hand to me took it and dropping to one knee gave her small kiss appropriate is an honor to meet you isis said liquid alluring alarming precious lovely manners despite his poor taste in may leave out the boy dont wish to be of how old

wine for three of us may have little more of what you gave me before still feel little woozy dollop of the clear liquid into one cup and it to me the rich scent had touch of something chemical that from the bar but it filled my mouth and sank into my with reassuring warmth isis slightly lost blood boy story might be interesting it have anything to do with why your head is shaved was part of the price for this girl who was rock at the time have feeling that she was worth the trade added amy still holding my hand may be at that said isis gazing at her sweet small nose and her soft shed kiss well should think if gently good blood under her round too even though theyre small they suit her amy didnt blush and hoped that she didnt understand what isis was saying would have been worth it interrupted if this fool accidentally her up before we could give her to our contact was going to give us valuable information for her understand why here said isis what do you need to know know wouldnt come to you if could get this information another way said apologetically she tell what the thoughtful look on her face meant think that the person who stole the girl were looking for might be vampire isis you know some way to locate the undead dont you do this one to me know him can find him not have to bring me something to work with at me thought back to seeing the man in the hollow church and his skin his dark hair the way that light to flow around him as best as could isis set her in the fur and her head on her while spoke and tried not to stare at her full hanging had told her all that could remember she blinked her black and said remember him do could hardly believe her amazing is would have sworn to you that he was dead should be hope that you can do better job than the last lot sat up running her along her pale round right then me see if can find him isis closed her and her dark glow around her amy forward looking amazed the glow reflected on her pink face casting sickly pallor over her heartbeat strong of blood to seep out of isis as her brow candy twisted into frown the dark glow grew and filling the air for about foot around her her the of blood swelled into small the dark glow to flicker and isis frown of concentration one of worry the in her grew didnt shed bead of sweat and didnt even see her draw breath but the glow around her like stubborn her and her arms to shake the blood in her still filling up to ripple swept through her body and out to touch her but stopped him at me with honest concern probably the first honest moment shown me she all right didnt know and drop of blood shook out splashing on the crease of her thigh and hanging to one strand of the black hair between her and the dark glow went out taking the blood with it in flash of heat and red steam isis on the fur cut lunged forward took her by the arms isis what you hurt shook her head rubbing her face into the white fur and murmuring something did you say rolled onto her back her arms crossed tightly over her chest for the first time she vulnerable she finally spoke had to lean close to hear her found your vampire she said but he might know that looking for him taken great to keep himself hidden should look for him at as quickly as you can turned to me with tired sympathy didnt see girl with him though and you might find him before he leaves twitch of her her pale of these will lead you out stood and one of her took me and amy to the door back to see whispering something to her stood to go but she caught his sleeve and him back for moment turned back to the door on amy said hell be along soon caught up with us after minute and silently to the end of the hall we got there another pale servant was waiting for us with of dark wood it to who the on velvet lining wooden hammer and two ash said was very kind of her the he beside the open door and back at me really hope we find your rachel he said like he was going to continue but then he out the door know quick way to said bet kicking himself now for not way to contact me few we were back to the first door wed on in this town and himself was greeting us the pulse from inside made the building

man odd you mind if we check it out anyway have real feeling that in here somewhere over his shoulder little nervous guess man but be quick dont want my that wrong you know course be in and out in minute stepped in and us towards the dance floor did you get anything out of the guy sent you to us no he said that his research was purely academic not for guess probably known though mean he is tight about that stuff didnt look very this is the dance floor man luck with too many arms was manning the above the crowd which more impenetrable tonight than ever before saw the bar on the other side of the crowd and knew where to start looking tried to slip along the edge of the crowd with scales and kept against me pressing me into the wall but took breath and kept moving nose filled with reek of thick sweat the music to build and came on toward the center of the dance floor howl that sent bitter under my clothing for second was back with my family in russia from the cold felt tug on the back of my shirt and that amy was following me her under my arm was somewhere behind me too delicately through his in front of me massive thing into the wall sending up cloud of granite dust to the floor and that it was werewolf in time to the music as it to rise man with thick scaled skin across rippling leapt on him thought that my odds were better on the dance floor amy in my arms as we between the crush of to wonder if the of finding this vampire were even good enough to merit this wasnt sure that could survive the crush of the crowd cold thing with countless writhing fell against me thrashing as if in the of drug overdose tripping me and at my woman who could have been an elf and beside me trembling at the torn of her clothing looming shape to my right fell away and saw him in flash of the his black staring deadly into the crowd the creature blocking my vision back but had seen all that to see bleeding eyeless thing and beat its arms against me but around it and toward the bar slipped past the waving monstrosity that had blocked my view before mountain of wet veined flesh and had almost through the crowd when clawed hand my arm was my ear down to his mouth seen enough man he back saw him sitting right there at the bar tried to peek through the crowd but it had again and we see thing dont think there to me must have been wishful thinking no saw him have to hurry too how long hell stick around man not there telling you its not even worth the bar turned to keep going but he caught my arm again do this dumb idea if you did find this vampire cat tear you apart he got your girl probably dead shook him off and between two dancing getting almost to the edge of the dance floor amy whirled around and threw up my arm just in time to knock away were glowing red and he had set of that could probably take my hand off the us tried to clear some space shot back up hardly touching the ground and him back at my arm while was still off balance and felt the surge of adrenaline that comes right when your body that its too late to save itself heavy thing hit my arm with thump and me back against someone with rough who me up the floor was head from his body by several and growing puddle of dark blood stood over him with blue sword in his hand in the where it wasnt streaked with blood wasnt the only one with secret or two he said by way of explanation spotted our boy didnt you bet his hide out is nearby too hurry off the sword and sheathed it in scabbard now belted to his hip the crowd parted for us the vampire up when he saw the crowd split and his when he us blink of the light he was on his and dashing from the room on after him amy keeping up valiantly behind us up set of set into the side of the wall and we up after him heading up huge staircase that to go up for more than the building could have the vampire turned off after three ran down hallway and slipped behind one of the but was close behind him and left it open for me out to amy to shut the door in case the vampire had any who might be trying to follow us was dark room that like storage space for equipment me on from the back of the room then made turn out of sight came to the door at the end of the room it like it had been torn off its didnt imagine that had done it and it wasnt without alarm that ran after him black hallway into space like cathedral the vault rose into obscurity above me and massive rose window stood ahead of me the black and only few cold slipped through the filter through the stone chamber and the sound reflected back to me from everywhere tell how many people were running much less where they were the in front of the altar saw pale and that they were rachel and two other shout nathan you whirled and in time to see the vampire shoot over my head leaping like panther into the behind me and him leap across the rest of the row was on the other side of the holding the wooden in his hand it to me and just barely had it open before saw the vampire again turning to face me out the hammer and one of the leapt over the soaring like grasshopper and drew gleaming knife in but he it and the in front of my face the blade lodged in the wood its silver point penetrating the velvet and nearly reaching my skin arms shook from the force of his throw he landed heavy beside me and to stand first move out the dagger almost my arms from their as on to the and the second the with crushing punch that sent me backwards the and the broken second stake and raised my hammer ready to drive the ash spike into his heart him saw running between the braced my against the stone floor and he was on me raised the stake he drew back the dagger for slash that could doubtless open my neck from throat to spine the stake went down there was blur and then my were empty and felt pain under my jaw of fire in my throat for an instant then all went numb hearing and touch single blur and do not know if my were open mind to dissipate but then felt the pain withdraw and lifeless voice said blood worth drinking closed on my neck and felt my spine crack must have fallen to the floor then could perceive sword flashing over me and steel crack then bone thought voice calling for me one set of walking toward the altar was content to let myself drift away and had almost forgotten the body lying with broken neck on the hard when felt warm touch on its cheek voice soft and almost recognizable spoke nathan felt my head turn and something in my neck my and amy handed me the hammer and stake stood and turned toward the altar the vampire was walking just ahead of me stepped up behind him and raised my which almost to be glowing the stake came down into his back and one two three with the hammer drove it in the vampire fell forward and blood to flow from his mouth me amy was kneeling beside whose arm and rib cage were knitting back together like wooden toy that apart when its string is but itself together at slight tug the vial of liquid that been giving me from his pocket and ran to the altar rachel her clothes torn and her face drawn like she might cry when she saw me her into my arms and she tried to put hers around me hero she whispered the allan sat down at his desk and the chair in close side drawer he took out piece of paper and his inkpot filling his pen allan at his paper in the orange glow from the lantern set back in the desk right hand corner pen cast forbidding line of shadow slanting across the page the inky darkness crouching in the of the lantern struggling glow the only other illumination came from lurid moonlight through thin and casting its bone pale glow onto the pine allan unfolded another page this one crowded with of in tight formation from left to right the of stepped into their in the shape of story outline the loose dry skeleton of tale lay exposed beneath their muscle and blushing skin allan the all prepared to disembark their task to form the tale of young man home from to find his childhood friend bride to be thus upsetting the apple cart of his life plan of course by his very time away from her he best the concept was simple one allan thought it had potential the public good simple romance this will be more he thought and to write at each other lost in the rapture of love based so deeply within their hearts that they had never seen it before about roger she knowing that the answer no longer is good he thought to raise the low light of the lantern almost done and the happy ending is just falling into place hardly dare to think it but may finish this story as he thought this sinuous wind the house slipping through the to chill him the and the lantern flame as the thin of great black willow gently on allan window and wall like stranger knocking on his chamber door was no stranger however the twisted ancient thing was older than allan its rapping on his window since his childhood thin drawn framed the bloated moon whose eerie radiation now the room directly the great eye down unblinkingly at the author who up through his window tiny frame with trepidation allan himself and once more on the incomplete page before him pen forth dancing out from its nib the author eye the lantern reflection or was it reflection for while the lantern spark in the chill breeze this burn was steady and true as the motion of its owner pen scratching out the rhythm of the willow the frenzied writing at last the author back with slight sigh as if both exhausted and satisfied by his effort hand to his forehead closed and face did it again he thought all that so the end to lose control again breath to its normal he to look at the page before him face soft as if caught between smile and he his loose cape over her darling he whispered am to take you one need never think of those left behind stepped together into his carriage her wide with wonder as she touched it and felt as if through her skin the unearthly nature of the and reins the took their within the car and his driver set the for few they up dust along the roadway then they raised their and took to the air afraid but knowing that no harm would come to her by his hand the even the shrinking to insignificance as they mounted the sky them the drew as if the themselves could be magnificent glow the carriage as they with the sky glory allan crushed the page in his hand and hurled it at the window you he cried will you never leave me be never finish story in peace his desk in vain the foul muse that drove him the next day allan sat on florally patterned chair in well furnished parlor measured sip of white wine from his crystal glass he at his host cultured man dressed in light suit of the current fashion and wearing his pale hair with heavy set of sideburns who him silver tray sandwich allan took sandwich between his you arthur arthur the tray onto the cherry table that stood in the center of his ordered chamber manner delicately balanced between somber and genial he their glasses is the writing these days my dear mr dreadful my dear mr mason allan had perfect story in my my hero returned home and his love nearly had it tied together before that blasted impulse came over me and writing like edgar though the most recent was not so morbid as my many thank arthur face assumed long suffering aspect of authoritative exasperation not familiar with mr works but assume you re to your unhealthy penchant for the fantastic far from penchant arthur is more like compulsion beast that waiting in the dark for the perfect moment then and of me screaming out through my quill perfectly awful arthur at the vivid description sure you know that you must curb this behavior if you wish to produce any writing fit for public consumption know allan but how am to do that know do not wish to make my thus but it is my me anew at every turn arthur raised critical brow you could make some headway if you your side the outlet of the colorful you so enjoy action you take to deny it nourishment will bring you closer to your goal and believe me allan you must take every opportunity to quash this uncivilized obsession if you intend to publish simply is no audience for fairy tales no literate audience at least is true allan admitted fidgeting with his that would not dream of one of these of literature to any publisher even tried the corrupted but once my have gone down that road nothing can recall their former life prodigal ink blooded simply lose their vitality when forced along the proper road arthur and his wine only you would restrain this morbid impulse of yours you might write something really worth reading hard enough listening to your wild speech without seeing it appear in the refined world of print like surly foreigner among genteel crowd allan hung his head holding his wine with both between his arched hair was slightly unkempt after his sleepless night and his clothing had look as if by mere proximity it had taken on the aspect of his weariness the back of his dark head and blinked bleary would drive it out he said softly but fear for what would remain you require rest from writing arthur might find that some time in an honest occupation would ground you somewhat improve your disposition it would allan rising and vainly his suit shall consider it in the however must be off have been gracious host as always arthur rose and shook his hand dear friend is always welcome to my counsel and my home he said hope soon to see you in better parted and allan made his way pensively from arthur gate the wheel in his and dust quarter mile from arthur gate he by halloo nathan he out to the empty road the reply came from above him and allan turned to see his friend in the fork of great tree had hunch you be at arthur today said nathan so thought wait here for you nathan lanky frame dressed in loose tan jacket fit into the branch like an elegant skeleton hair fell loosely across face that always to have knowing smirk hidden just beneath its surface his body with rakish energy allan said nathan unfolding and lowering his to the roadside how goes life for the quintessential american author know allan dryly before in another tone entirely another story last night nathan against his tree nathan shook his head mean finished another story it is finished again shall it see the rosy fingered dawn nathan you read these of mine know just as well as that they have no future no potential best they are faery tales at worst into macabre no healthy mind need ever see instead you would write what something worth reading worth writing want to write as do tale set in our real world of who might live therein not of some airy demesne beyond the is that more desirable than what you write today will read such they are worth you never finish such how can they be worth is precisely why must excise this malignant instinct do you write to earn living suppose do you ask choose to write rather than become fisherman or carpenter though you face such difficulty is that suppose it is because enjoy my craft would not be happy thus from it at its heart then your writing as opposed to working otherwise is for yourself suppose one could see it thus really nathan your queer of conversation have new level the statement nathan continued writing is for you allan not for the or some audience you seem unable to write normally why not embrace your tales as they are leave behind the one unhappiness in the art you admit is source of pleasure strike chord with the most ancient of mankind the tales basic to humanity them and they will create an audience need not pander to what you imagine their are speak and they shall listen allan crouched over his desk once more pen in hand and mind blank story an outline he had laboriously some time ago had filled his pen and raised it the nib descending towards the paper before the sound came the gentle persistent tapping of the gnarled primeval willow touching the window with long insistent awoke with passionate determined flame though the only light came from the moon allan filled page after page the from his mind onto the paper before they had in practiced in and their the now in their true unhindered by any stricture continued long into the night until the eldritch orb had sunk into the waiting of the willow raised perpetually skyward arthur up from the of nights frenzied and allan in the eye is this he the he in his left hand decided that since much success with more traditional might see what sort of work produced if let my imagination go freely allan somewhat less self assured than he had been the previous night in name could have possessed you to do such thing cried arthur nearly raising his voice all said the day before why have you abandoned of literary progress for some self indulgent fantasy shook the at allan raising them like belt above the head of disobedient son is nothing but tale child of creation less fit to be than to be told around an open fire at the hovel of some peasant spoke the last word with such heavy intonation that allan shrank back before the physical wave of sound from arthur throat you hate the modern system of literature you personally despise the works the or the progress made since for moment allan could hardly do more than shake his head no of course not why arthur barreled on do you disregard them all and return to this superstitious babble this morbid paganistic drivel do you disregard my my careful advice given in the best of friendship and designed only to save you from sinking into this very type of corruption this literary debauchery at allan him and demanding response you write decent tales with that willow at your window allan cried out at last stepping forward and casting his arms open arthur with this demanding pleading interrogation rap constantly against the wall the wind always demanding my attention could any writer accommodate the of popular literature with the very of nature knocking upon his door arthur down his nose at the distraught author his complaint with pure disdain scantily concealed by the veneer of politeness that animated the construct that was arthur mason tree tree forced you to write this my dear mr must admit this far fetched even by your even your nathan might have difficulty believing you don know what this is like said allan shaking his head nathan would understand completely as he said it allan that his statement was true well said arthur then take your story to that hedonist and let him defend you when no civilized publisher will approach you you insist on me shall not hold you that he the at allan and left the room allan slowly up the and them in order then turned and left through the door opposite that arthur had taken making his way past his host doorman without assistance and setting off on foot towards nathan residence several away nathan read the package of in silence his only the steady progress of his and occasional replacement of allan sat nervously across from him in chair nathan had probably upholstered himself patchwork design of fabric easily more stuffing than any other furniture item of the period long last nathan the end and set down his reading on the table between them allan forward unconsciously the best story you ever written allan and back into the chair his face in imitation of his he you don think it waste of ink and paper futile expedition into morbidity or literary debauchery no said nathan aghast is one of the works read in to the storyteller instinct within us all yet is entirely original dear friend you have done it they may rail against you at first they may decry you as heathen or literary savage but while those in power say such will read your tales and see their true worth me when say that you will be read century from now allan though dubious as to that possibility felt some temptation from the compliment mainly it him the encouragement he still nathan to show the story to printer he knew and allan left it with him then home under the spreading with smile on his face felt now that perhaps nathan was right although the man was somewhat peculiar he had both an unimpeachable honesty and certain propensity for insight it was undeniable that the had an originality to them mind fruit had at last and he found the taste less bitter than and like them filled his head as he the long road home was evening and the sky burned orange in the west when he home at last fiery colors filled the western sky before him though the sun itself had the and few dark circled overhead as allan drew closer he distinguished new cloud pillar rising directly ahead road of smoke in the west its source hidden by the very hillock that concealed his house from the traveler until one had nearly its door allan fled as one scattering on the breeze that scattered the warning plume ran the last distance crested the hill puffing to reveal arthur below walking to the carriage before allan house as two wrapped great saw in and loaded it onto the vehicle roof arthur in the door looking up at allan for moment then he turned and shut the door behind him the driver snapped the reins and set the on as they forth allan trapped by the carriage following it up the hillock and past himself the heavy had been drawn across its watched as the carriage drew still more distant the still kicking up dust along the roadway they had gone he until the scent of him to himself turned to regard the pillar still rising behind his house and ran to see what had been done the corner he saw great bonfire mass of flaming wood stood before him heat singeing him and sparks flying too close to his house was moment before he what else had the wall beneath his window was stump with black and ancient bark thoughtless panic allan flew to the stream that ran by his house and frantically throwing of water onto the pyre were not of the act futility nor even of the nights spent tormented by the twisted thing instead all that filled his mind was the tree constant presence in his life growing with him and beside him its persistent that he had higher truer to write the simple beauty of the great black tree for its own sake could do nothing to quench the hewn burning but when the night sky grew dark above him and the fire to black ashes to spill forth and extinguish the final he did not weep he bethought himself of the loss of the tree considered also arthur motivation and whether some good might not come of this after all the circle of ashes he stood and turned towards the in which it was his habit to walk when in pensive mood stepped slowly beneath the gust of wind stirring up the ashes behind him in great eddy burning brand that rose up and dispersed on the as though it were the willow last breath allan beneath the for time drifting through his mind like great of fog strangely beautiful but impossible to penetrate considered arthur intervention considered that it might be better to accept the fog and continue as his lifelong friend had to write that would read for after all what purpose writing if not to be read without that torturous willow he might be free to write whatever he saw fit if he still could not he could at any time follow arthur advice and seek profession more grounded in reality that would be more healthy for his mind found himself along the bank of low wide stream and himself to follow its current as it turned to the elder rose above him beech smooth bark gray green pennant on slope and standing out between the dark cracked of the great few magnificent still bearing the three stroke symbol of the british king towering black birch leaves impossibly high above him as the stream wound its way through the grown so great as to eclipse that feature of the landscape they had once crowded about for sweet water as allan continued his pace to climb across the of the slumbering was hardly enough room for his slim frame between the that any fleeting mortal trespass from between the antediluvian allan set his softly down onto the carpet of needles and stopped him the sweet water of the stream grew stand of black lay rotting across the rivulet the living the grove while younger still small and not yet as knotted and gnarled as their sprang up where the ground the fell and their first grown from the very that now lay dead continued unabated continuous line from the most ancient of their allan forward jaw slightly slack until his the rough bark of twisted three trunked willow whose were each than allan himself at its base allan wrapped his arms around the stoic tree and let forth moan cry of agony that him as the first seeped from the of his and slid down his falling to the ground and though the fallen leaves and needles to join the water of the stream flowing through the ground beneath them the had while crisis were still out number of false flew to in louisiana of these was of threat against itself threat eventually

coalition the noted that the provided great opportunity to engage russia and the and the to think broadly about who might have the iraq sudan and iran aloud how much evidence the would need in order to deal with these pointing out that major could take up to days to assemble two more of the on september the first meeting he that the was at war with new and different kind of enemy the to go beyond their work and develop strategy to eliminate and punish those who support them as they worked on the and of the upcoming campaign they considered paper that went beyond al to propose the elimination of terrorism as threat to our way of life an aim that would include other international terrorist in the meeting on september in the to refine how the fight against al would be the agreed that the overall message should be that anyone supporting al would risk harm the would need to integrate diplomacy financial intelligence and military into an strategy the also on and what it could do to turn the against al that if decided not to help the it too would be at risk the same day of state richard met with the pakistani ambassador to the and the visiting head of military intelligence service ahmed said that the to take seven to stop al at its border and end all logistical support for ladin to give the blanket and landing for all necessary military and intelligence to provide territorial access to and allied military intelligence and other personnel to conduct against al to provide the with intelligence information to continue to publicly condemn the terrorist to cut off all of fuel to the and stop from going to and if the evidence bin ladin and al and the continued to harbor them to break with the government made its decision afternoon of state at the beginning of an meeting that pakistani had agreed to every request for support in the war on terrorism the next day the embassy in confirmed that and his top military had agreed to all seven will need full support as it proceeds with us the embassy noted said the government of was making substantial in use of its territory and that he would pay domestic price standing in was certain to suffer counterbalance that he to show that was from his the september meeting when reply led discussion of an appropriate ultimatum to the also ordered to develop military plan against the the the to strike the step back wait to see if they got the message and hit them hard if they did not made clear that the military should focus on that would influence the behavior also the state which on the following day to the paper titled for for and the paper took it as given that ladin would continue to act against the even while under control therefore detailed specific for the surrender ladin and his chief al tell the what the knew about al and its close all terrorist free all and comply with all the state an ultimatum to the produce ladin and his and shut down al within to or the will use all necessary to destroy the terrorist infrastructure the state did not expect the to comply state and would plan to build an international coalition to go into would consult with and other allies and request intelligence and other support from according to their and the plan detailed public stance america would use all its to eliminate terrorism as threat punish those responsible for the hold and other responsible for providing sanctuary to work with coalition to eliminate terrorist and and avoid malice toward any people religion or culture that he quickly that the administration would have to invade with ground the early to the and on military were disappointing tommy the commanding general of told us that the was dissatisfied the military said did not have an off the shelf plan to eliminate the al threat in the did not in his view amount to such plan these diplomatic and military were over the weekend of september as his war council at david were vice cheney of paul and chief of the plan for intelligence and mounting covert into to work with afghan who would join the fight against al would act jointly with the military later this proposal saying it had been turning point in his thinking the on the preliminary plan for that the military had put together drew on the campaign plan the had begun in november as an addition to the strike it had been refining since added new element the possible significant use of ground and that is where reportedly his attention hearing from his senior with the contents of the he would issue to set all the into motion prepared paper that then considered with on monday morning september the purpose of this meeting he saying is to assign for the first wave of the war against terrorism today written set of slightly refined during the morning meeting and to develop plan for homeland defense directed of state to deliver an ultimatum to the along the that his department had originally the state was also to develop plan to stabilize and to be prepared to notify russia and when were imminent addition and his new legal for covert action in the administration first of on ladin thereafter authorized broad new for the instructed and to develop further the david military plan to attack the and al if the the ultimatum the also to ensure that robust to protect american military against terrorist attack were he directed paul to craft plan to target al and seize its assets staff had begun leading on terrorist fund raising by september by september had of his foreign and received of general aid search and rescue equipment and personnel and medical assistance the same day of state was by ahmed regarding two day visit to during which the pakistani intelligence chief had met with omar and the omar response was not negative on all these the administration knew that was unlikely to turn over ladin the draft presidential directive on al into new directive now titled the to the the directive would now extend to global war on terrorism not just on al also incorporated the determination not to distinguish between and those who harbor them included determination to use military force if necessary to end al sanctuary in the new directive formally on october after the fighting in had already begun included new material by each targeted terrorist group the old draft directive on al in effect the first annex the would strive to eliminate all terrorist dry up their financial support and prevent them from of mass destruction the goal was the elimination of terrorism as threat to our way of life had immediately after the attack whether regime might have had hand in it iraq had been an enemy of the for and was the only place in the world where the was engaged in ongoing combat as former pilot the was struck by the apparent sophistication of the operation and some of the piloting especially high speed dive into the told us he iraqi support for palestinian suicide as well about other possible that could be involved the told us he also thought about iran written that on the evening of september told him and some of his staff to explore possible iraqi links to if did this the telling them if he linked in any way he the of account to be incorrect acknowledged that he might well have spoken to at some point him about iraq to presidential office sent memo to on september titled of on iraq in the september chief staffer on in its conclusion that only some anecdotal evidence linked iraq to al the memo found no compelling case that iraq had either or the along few foreign intelligence the czech report an april meeting between atta and an iraqi intelligence officer in chapter and polish report that personnel at the headquarters of iraqi intelligence in were told before september to go on the streets to gauge crowd reaction to an unspecified event that the case for links between iraq and al was weak the memo pointed out that ladin the secularism of regime the memo said there was no confirmed on with ladin on unconventional the afternoon of according to contemporaneous instructed to obtain quickly as much information as possible the indicate that he also told that he was not simply interested in striking empty training thought the response should consider wide range of and the secretary said his instinct was to hit at the same time not only ladin later that at the time he had been considering either one of them or perhaps someone else as the responsible party to the issue of what if anything to do about iraq was really engaged at david on iraq along with many were in briefing for the told us the administration was concerned that iraq would take advantage of the that in the first david session by the what the administration should do about iraq made the case for striking iraq during this round of the war on terrorism paper for the david briefing book on the strategic concept for the war on terrorism three priority for initial action al and iraq that of the three al and iraq strategic threat to the iraq long standing involvement in terrorism was along with its interest in of mass destruction that not that iraq was ultimately the source of the terrorist problem and should therefore be said that was not able to justify his belief that iraq was behind paul was always of the view that iraq was problem that had to be dealt with told us he saw this as one way of this event as way to deal with the iraq problem said that did not give argument much weight to worry about iraq in the following week said saw as the priority told bob that the decision not to invade iraq was made at the morning session on september iraq was not even on the table during the september afternoon session which dealt solely with said that when her on sunday september he said the focus would be on although he still for iraq should the country take some action or the administration eventually determine that it had been involved in the the september meeting there was some further discussion of phase two of the war on terrorism ordered the to be ready to deal with iraq if against with to include possibly iraqi oil the continued to press the case for dealing with iraq to on september in memo he that if there was even percent chance that was behind the attack maximum priority should be on that threat that the odds were far more than in praise for the attack his long record of involvement in terrorism and that was an iraqi agent and iraq was behind the attack on the the next day the argument writing to about the interest of conspirator in the manila air plot in an laden plane into headquarters and about information from foreign government regarding involvement in the of gulf flight this background he why so little thought had been devoted to the danger of suicide seeing failure of imagination and mind set that september several for his as they worked on their contingency he the nature of the conflict the to specific or only the al and told us the administration all the war and certain underlying them as any prudent organization or leader should do tommy the commanding general of guidance that each regional commander should assess what these meant for his area of responsibility knew he would soon be striking the and al in he told us he now how that action was connected to what might need to be done in yemen or iraq september met with british tony blair and the two the global conflict ahead blair about iraq the that iraq was not the immediate problem of his administration he had expressed different view but he was the one responsible for making the told us that he was pushing independently to do more robust on military in iraq during the summer before request that the time was not right also dusting off for full invasion of iraq during this period said the commander told us he his appeal for further military to respond to iraqi shortly after both because he personally felt that iraq and al might be engaged in some form of collusion and because he worried that might take advantage of the to move against his internal in the northern or southern of iraq where the was flying regular to enforce iraqi no fly said that again turned down the request to guide his administration for war on thursday september the nation before joint session of he said we are country to danger the blamed al for and the embassy and for the first time declared that al was responsible for the cole reiterated the ultimatum that had already been privately the must act and act immediately he said will hand over the or they will share in their fate the added that america quarrel was not with islam the enemy of america is not our many it is not our many arab enemy is radical network of and every government that them faced hard he pointed out nation in every region now decision to make you are with us or you are with the that the new war went beyond ladin war on terror with al but it does not end there he said will not end until every terrorist group of global reach been found stopped and the had message for the the hour is coming when america will act and you will make us also had message for those outside the is civilization fight he said ask every nation to join us military to attack in with and other on september and october titled the operation code word was to avoid the of who associate the power of infinite justice with god alone to the operational name still used for in the plan had four phases the and its allies would move into the region and arrange to operate from or over neighboring such as and in the following by overwhelming international sympathy for the air and would hit key al and an innovative joint effort and would be to work together with each major afghan faction opposed to the the and on october the for were substantially after arduous effort by the end of that month the would carry out decisive all of national power ground to topple the regime and eliminate al sanctuary in in northern fell to coalition assault by afghan and on november days later the had fled from early december all major had fallen to the coalition december leader from was as the chairman of interim administration had been from the rule of the december afghan with limited support engaged al in cave complex march the engagement of the war was fought in the mountainous area south of against large force of al the three week battle was substantially successful and almost all al took refuge in equally mountainous and lightly frontier as of july ladin and are still to be at large civilian and military turned to the indefinite task of what the armed call security and stability about two of the start of combat several hundred and backed by the striking power of aircraft and much infrastructure of intelligence and support had combined with afghan and small number of other coalition to destroy regime and disrupt al had or about quarter of the enemy known al military commander and principal figure in the plot had been by air strike to senior officer who devise the overall strategy the provided intelligence experience cash covert action and to tribal allies turn the military combat firepower logistics and these initial won by the middle of the global conflict against islamist terrorism different kind of struggle as by the one of the principal energy facing us is increasing our energy in ways that protect and improve the environment the directed to propose legislation that would significantly reduce and from power generation through cap and trade program program coupled with appropriate to address local would provide significant health even as we increase energy and maintain reasonable electricity work on this issue given us insight that believe will be helpful to you the more learn about the cost and of the current and future regulatory regime to which power will be subjected if we do not have new legislation the more am convinced that we can and must develop approach that the environment and public health while reducing the cost to and industry and the size of both the state and federal government machinery necessary to achieve that protection is possible to achieve better at lower but not if we simply add yet another program on top of all of the the current been enormously successful but we can do better cost can be for power and through comprehensive legislative package look forward to working with you to develop such an approach to reduce from power generation applaud for tackling this important issue and for that cap and trade program is the best way to achieve these we have significant with as analysis to date that it could increase electricity by as much as which we believe is unacceptable addition the combination of emission and timing is not feasible and could threaten the reliability of electricity supply are concerned that short for installation of could lead power to be taken off line at important times which could lead to electricity addition there are number of that should consider that does not address as would make some unnecessary but would not eliminate them than add yet another layer of environmental on top of the we believe that should eliminate those unnecessary also does not have an allocation scheme lesson we should learn from the success of the cap and trade program is that when certain key can be resolved through clear legislation we can avoid of litigation business uncertainty and and environmental protection and most importantly the strongly in any pollutant bill the in will cost too much and endanger our energy security by causing too much electricity generation to switch from coal to natural gas gas should be in the context of climate change which is being by the level working group for all of these the must oppose my testimony today will elaborate further on these key the last we have made substantial progress towards environmental quality under the this time gross domestic product almost the same time we have reduced of six key air by while coal consumption and energy consumption ago george into law the most far reaching to the since its enactment in in those was the cap and trade program the first program specifically to the utility sector which is significant environmental and public health at fraction of the initial cost and with relatively little government bureaucracy is time to revisit and update the once again in order to achieve the additional to address public health and environmental in the most cost effective manner the is its emission reduction goal at fraction of the because it and innovative thinking and long range the program cap on to ensure that the environmental goal is met and an innovative market based allowance trading program to achieve the goal at cost are the currency with which compliance with the is rather than government decide the most cost effective way to use available to comply that reduce their below the number of they hold may trade with other in the system sell them to other or save them for future use are neither on trading nor government second guessing trading for energy conservation and technology innovation that can both lower the cost of compliance and yield pollution prevention the allowance market price or value on each ton of not the association of monetary value with reduced innovation in the scrubber by approximately and scrubber removal from to and experimentation led to the blending of to lower ensure that the cap is met and to provide credibility also are to install that continuously monitor and report the proven to be an excellent model for cap and trade with the program been nearly percent and annual of from power have already been reduced over million about percent from than have to human health and provided to the environment sooner rain were dramatically reduced over large of the and trading did not result in geographic shifting of or hot as some feared the significant progress we have made under the air from power are still to serious public health and environmental these extensively in her testimony before you on july than reiterate her testimony will emphasize just few of her key

power industry since the passage of the in significant in air quality throughout the country however from power generation continue to result in serious health environmental and economic the electric power industry was responsible for of dioxide of nitrogen oxide and of in the as the flexible market based approach to reducing from power in sharp contrast to the complex web of which currently confront the industry the and the have to specific environmental and public health by separate regulatory to address the specific individual program its own approach on its own to serve its own purpose to the and will be forced to follow the same approach in future is time to consolidate and simplify to achieve our clean air comprehensive legislative approach with mandatory could replace good portion of the current regulatory with system that will reduce the administrative burden on industry and use market based to lower compliance reduce and increase national energy security by providing the industry with more certainty about its future regulatory such an approach we can achieve environmental and public health protection more effectively and at less cost we do it the way it will be win win are many in place that will reduce air from electric power generation include both federal and state that address variety of and number of hazardous air include the for particulate matter and ozone the section and the the new source review new source performance and the regional haze rule the regulation of power does not end with is by settlement agreement to issue by the end of standard to require source specific of and other hazardous air from electric are by the end of will also be to comply with either source specific or trading program to meet to reduce regional haze is that the fine particle and ozone now in place will also result in further regulation of power that when full implementation of such as the acid rain program the the for and trucks the heavy duty diesel engine and the low gasoline and diesel fuel are taken into account additional will be to bring into attainment will be to develop for these addition and are also to reduce damage from acid rain and nitrogen deposition and will have to find some way to significantly reduce and it is probable that power will be to reduce their significantly generation for significant percentage of these and our analysis that there are significant available at lower cost than from other know that if they do not get the from power they will have to impose significant reduction on other local industrial and commercial or impose local transportation control current law the necessary would be through the development of individual state will not just control their own however will be reaching out to control power and large industrial in other because transport from other to both ozone and fine particle pollution in many is what in the eastern part of the country when that from in other were significantly to their hour ozone non attainment section of the state can petition and request that require from outside the state the state is to relief if that the are significantly to the state nonattainment problem requirement adopted in response to section that in number of eastern reduce was recently upheld by the of for the of columbia now know that authority to address transport pollution through to or by issuing rule like the we anticipate that will be turning to these of control early in the process those of us who are traveling that path with the current and believe it will eventually take us to our environmental goal it been and still is very rocky road for industry the and other one at time series of regulatory for the power industry is not the optimal approach for the environment the power generation sector or american most needing to install control equipment to meet these it is likely that this approach would lead to installation of that become obsolete and capital as additional are the attainment of individual and not only impose on these but also can increase complexity for which face when cross state are by limited that may constrain available compliance and thwart long range and other point to the need for nationally approach that could reduce cost while improving environmental progress and accountability the and believe there is better way one that could cost american and industry far less than under current law and ensure protection of the air we breathe in far more certain straightforward manner know that many of this share that belief and are also working to develop such an approach would provide power with more certainty about their regulatory future and thus allow them to make wiser about in new technology which would improve energy security is such proposal will build on the of the cap and trade program would establish national cap and trade for and from power with appropriate to address local an approach will benefit the power generation industry the economy and the while improving public health and the environment front knowledge of future for multiple would lead to follow significantly different and less expensive compliance at individual with compliance which must be made as are in sequential manner under the current law the come from the opportunity to make cost effective plant investment and retirement with full knowledge of upcoming and rather than in add on control equipment to meet the of each regulation advance knowledge and certainty regarding environmental will have even greater value over the coming decade as the electric power industry further structural package of that both the regulatory as well as many future environmental needs would provide the degree of certainty and flexibility for the industry while the necessary emission at lower cost than under current law exchange for flexibility in to control full accounting of through continuous and is essential as well as significant for failing to comply have been critical to the success of the encouraging individual to find the most cost effective of compliance with the collective emission reduction goal technological innovation economic activity and cost to industry and and for the control of and exist now and are to become available over the next several the air pollution control and technology industry is to continue to respond with cost effective compliance just as they have done for the past predictable demand for such over the next is preferable to the boom and bust cycle by the current regulatory approach approach also would reduce administrative and national cap and trade program with appropriate for and could provide the emission necessary to bring significant number of into attainment with the ozone and fine particle those that would not be brought into attainment by these would need significantly emission to come into attainment approach would significantly reduce the state to conduct modeling and regulatory to attain the the cap and trade program is with relatively small staff on strong state of the art data and well designed national cap and trade can help use government and taxpayer more efficiently at both the state and federal level ensure that environmental are met cap that significant of the environment by reducing overall of local is important in conjunction with trading the that the approach include appropriate to address local such as the unlikely occurrence of an hot spot or area of concentrated will go long way towards local addition will be modeling that will predict where will occur the cap and trade program we have not seen local hot because the highest are often the most cost effective to control and therefore the most likely to control as and the are still in the process of our proposal are shaping our may provide valuable basis as you weigh the before you will also guide our assessment of other are structured to ensure consistency with the the of increasing energy the protection and improvement of the environment and increasing our nation energy supply must be advanced that end energy diversity the preservation of electricity generation and transmission reliability and improvement of energy efficiency energy intensity of the electric power industry should be key consideration particular to prevent the reoccurrence of energy and price volatility diverse mix of fuel should be on share the desire expressed in to significantly reduce and cap of and from power generation applaud your of market based particularly cap and trade as powerful tool in environmental protection this way on successful of the do however oppose because of with the bill both with some that are in the bill and with some that are missing believe the emission and timing in the bill will be too costly for and will endanger national energy security believe the bill is missing some it should address the allocation scheme and integration with we oppose inclusion of in this bill let me explain some of our specific about the and in the bill are concerned that the significant are too quickly do not believe it is reasonable to expect all the control technology to be in that time frame without very high and electricity reliability meet these may need to be taken off line during critical could arise as large of capacity are taken out of service for extended of time to install the control equipment necessary to meet the reduction the time frame would force many to make these simultaneously would significantly reduce the amount of generating capacity available to meet consumer electrical needs have not the specific in but useful information is provided by the analyses and to respond to request from and with the analyses to request from and the analysis when we and reduction similar to reduction more modest than and no we did not find significant on coal production or electricity in the analysis to the request that had and reduction similar to we found significant approximately decline of coal generation and increase in electricity to the reference case depending on of energy technology penetration the source specific control for is also problematic have not seen anything that that every coal fired power plant would be able to achieve source specific for by without considerable fuel switching which would be very disruptive to our economy and undermine energy security addition the same level of reduction at plant that of and plant that of regardless of cost is neither efficient nor necessary are also very concerned about the outdated power plant provision every plant over old to meet and modification unnecessary and could undermine the of the cap and trade approach to make where it is most economical to do so is one of the cap and trade should be less costly than command and control that achieve the same or even you have hard cap as you would under emission at specific source does not reduce the overall level of pollution it just industry flexibility about where to make the additional such as the outdated power provision on top of cap and trade program is very likely to increase without providing significant environmental we have about what is not in our experience on the with the and the the benefit of certain key decided by rather than left to resolution of key whatever is and the for the program to get tied up in protracted litigation the most important program element not in the bill is integration of this new program with the effective market based approach would make some of the unnecessary for example depending on the ultimate cap chosen by this type of legislation would obviate the need for and new source review case by case technology for power missing from is the scheme for an allocation scheme numerous the be off or be handed out for free they are not should they be based on heat input or electrical and steam output power that do not emit air be given allowance be and if so how frequently be fuel neutral in these and other are important environmental and energy policy with significant equity may not be efficient for to make these in are other as well that this should consider such as with state and regional like the and the reduction in the east the may also wish to consider to track environmental progress to evaluate the efficacy of the program this bill would establish the strongly for in or any pollutant bill sharp in from the electricity generating sector alone would cause dramatic shift from coal to natural gas and thus would run the risk of national energy security substantially increasing energy and the will not support any legislation that would cause significant decline in our nation ability to use coal as major source of current and future electricity the same time the will not support any legislation that does not enhance the cleanliness of coal fired electricity generation and promote future for clean coal short the clean coal policy as critical component of our nation energy and environmental that other of energy also have critical role to play as said when she before you in july in this bill will slow down if not prevent the consensus necessary for passage of legislation to control multiple from power and both believe consensus on the appropriate and timing for of and is achievable relatively soon should not delay the public health and environmental from reduction of these while we wait for consensus to develop on agree that climate change is serious issue we need to address never been regulated as pollutant under the and does not pose any direct threat to human health unlike and the current body of scientific knowledge does not provide information regarding atmospheric of or reduction necessary to prevent dangerous interference with the climate system april the level policy review of this issue and was provided with initial that he accepted and on june that regard the is two major on climate science and advanced energy and sequestration the now billion annually on climate science to reduce commitment unmatched by any other nation the will accelerate priority research and the application of advanced energy and sequestration that the real answer to climate change in the long term in the development and global introduction of such in this century the cabinet level policy review is ongoing as greenhouse gas are to grow exponentially in the world in the next two we must evaluate the of imposing domestic as very high cost against potentially low cost for and carbon in the world appreciate the role of in generating important and the importance of new approach to in the power sector look forward to the additional you will need to address these important and to working with the to develop an approach that the can support the history of legislation is one of great made possible by bipartisan thank you for the opportunity to work with you to continue that great tradition the been upon to examine the financial and economic crisis that our country and explain its to the american people are keenly aware of the significance of our charge given the economic damage that america in the wake of the financial crisis since the task was first to determine what and how it so that we could understand why it we present our encourage the american people to join us in making their own based on the evidence in our inquiry we do not learn from history we are unlikely to fully recover from it on and in washington with stake in the status quo may be to wipe from memory the of this crisis or to suggest that no one could have or them report to expose the identify responsibility unravel and help us understand how the crisis could have been is an attempt to record history not to rewrite it nor allow it to be help our fellow better understand this crisis and its we also present specific at the end of in and of this report the subject of this report is of no small consequence to this nation the profound of and were neither in the road nor an dip in the financial and business we have come to expect in free market economic system was fundamental financial upheaval if you havoc in and across this country as this report goes to print there are more than million who are out of work cannot find full time work or have given up looking for work four million have lost their to foreclosure and another four and half million have slipped into the foreclosure process or are seriously behind on their mortgage trillion in household wealth with retirement and life swept away large and small have felt the sting of deep recession is much anger about what and justifiably so people who by all the now find themselves out of work and uncertain about their future the collateral damage of this crisis been real people and real the of this crisis are likely to be felt for generation the nation no easy path to economic strength so many we our exploration with our own and some preliminary knowledge about how the financial system came to the brink of collapse at the time of our appointment to this independent panel much had already been written and said about the crisis all of us have been deeply affected by what we have learned in the course of our inquiry have been at various times fascinated and even by what we saw and read been journey of revelation attention over the past two been on the by the federal government to provide massive financial assistance to stabilize the financial system and rescue large financial that were too systemically important to fail those the deep surrounding be long into the future our mission was to ask and answer this central question how did it come to pass that in our nation was forced to choose between two stark and painful risk the total collapse of our financial system and economy or inject of taxpayer into the financial system and an array of as millions of still lost their their and their this report we detail the of the crisis simple summary as we see it is useful at the outset the that the potential for crisis were in the making it was the collapse of the housing by low interest easy and available credit scant regulation and toxic that was the spark that string of which led to full blown crisis in the fall of of in risky had become throughout the financial system as mortgage related were and sold to around the world the bubble burst of of in in and mortgage related shook as well as financial that had significant to those and had heavily against them not just in the but around the world the were by such as synthetic the crisis seismic in september with the failure of and the impending collapse of the insurance giant american by lack of transparency of the balance of major financial coupled with tangle of among to be too big to fail the credit to seize up ground to halt the stock market plummeted the economy into deep recession the financial system we little resemblance to that of our generation the in the past three alone have been remarkable the financial have become increasingly the efficiency speed and complexity of financial and is access to and lower of than ever before the financial sector itself become much more dominant force in our economy to the amount of debt by the financial sector from trillion to trillion more than doubling as share of gross domestic product the very nature of many relatively staid private to publicly taking greater and more diverse of the commercial of the assets more than double the level in the eve of the crisis in financial sector of all corporate in the up from in this transformation been critical to the analysis to our major and which are based on the in this report they are with the hope that may be learned to help avoid future catastrophe conclude this financial crisis was avoidable the crisis was the result of human action and inaction not of or computer gone haywire the of finance and the public of our financial system and to question understand and manage within system essential to the well being of the american public was big miss not stumble the business cycle cannot be crisis of this magnitude need not have paraphrase the fault not in the but in us the expressed view of many on and in washington that the crisis could not have been or there were warning the tragedy was that they were or was an explosion in risky and an unsustainable rise in housing widespread of egregious and predatory dramatic in household mortgage debt and exponential growth in financial trading unregulated and short term among many other red there was pervasive permissiveness little meaningful action was taken to quell the in timely manner the prime example is the federal pivotal failure to stem the flow of toxic which it could have done by setting prudent mortgage the federal was the one entity to do so and it did not the record of our examination is replete with evidence of other financial made bought and sold mortgage they never did not care to examine or knew to be defective on of of of borrowing that had to be each and every night by mortgage and major and blindly on credit rating as their of risk else could one expect on highway where there were neither speed nor neatly painted conclude widespread in financial regulation and supervision proved devastating to the stability of the financial the were not at their in no small part due to the widely accepted faith in the self correcting nature of the and the ability of financial to effectively police themselves than of and reliance on self regulation by financial by former federal chairman alan and by successive and and actively by the powerful financial industry at every turn had stripped away key which could have avoid catastrophe approach had up in oversight of critical with of at risk such as the shadow banking system and over the counter addition the government permitted financial to pick their preferred in what race to the supervisor we do not accept the view that the power to protect the financial system had ample power in many and they chose not to use it give just three the and could have more capital and risky at the big investment did not the federal of and other could have down on in the run up to the crisis did not and could have stopped the runaway mortgage train did not case after case after case continued to rate the they as safe and sound even in the face of mounting often them just before their collapse where authority they could have sought it often they the political political and ideological environment that constrained well as the fortitude to critically challenge the and the entire system they were to oversee in the regulatory system in many as financial as the report will show the financial industry itself key role in weakening regulatory on and did not surprise the that an industry of such wealth and power would exert pressure on policy and to the financial sector billion in federal and political action in the sector made more than billion in campaign us was the extent to which the nation was of the necessary strength and independence of the oversight necessary to safeguard financial stability conclude dramatic of corporate governance and risk management at many systemically important financial were key cause of this crisis was view that for self preservation inside major financial would shield them from fatal risk taking without the need for steady regulatory hand which the would stifle innovation many of these recklessly taking on too much risk with too little capital and with too much dependence on short term many this reflected fundamental change in these particularly the large investment and bank holding which their increasingly on risky trading that produced hefty took on enormous in and supporting and and selling of in mortgage related synthetic financial icarus they never feared flying ever closer to the sun of these grew aggressively through poorly executed acquisition and integration that made effective management more the of told the that billion position in highly rated mortgage would not in any way have excited my attention and the of investment bank said he spent small fraction of of his time on those this instance too big to fail meant too big to manage and credit rating mathematical as reliable of judgment in too many often risk management risk justification in an environment of cheap money intense competition and light often the quick deal the short term proper consideration of long term those the big the payoff on the upside could be huge and the downside limited was the case up and down the the corporate to the mortgage broker on the street examination revealed stunning of governance and irresponsibility will read among other about senior ignorance of the and of the billion exposure to mortgage related quest for bigger market share and which led it to ramp up its exposure to risky and as the housing market was peaking and the costly surprise when top management that the company billion in super senior and supposedly super safe mortgage related that in of in conclude combination of excessive borrowing risky and lack of transparency put the financial system on collision course with crisis this vulnerability was related to of corporate governance and regulation but it is significant enough by itself to warrant our attention here the leading up to the crisis too many financial as well as too many to the hilt leaving them vulnerable to financial distress or ruin if the value of their declined even modestly for example as of the five major investment and morgan operating with extraordinarily thin capital one measure their leverage were as high as to meaning for every in assets there was only in capital to cover than drop in asset could wipe out firm make worse much of their borrowing was short term in the overnight the borrowing had to be each and every day for example at the end of had billion in equity and billion in and was borrowing as much as billion in the overnight market was the equivalent of small business with in equity borrowing million with of that due each and every day cant really ask were they thinking when it that too many of them were thinking alike the leverage was often in off balance sheet and through window dressing of financial available to the public the of leverage were and freddie mac the two behemoth government for example by the end of and combined leverage ratio they and stood at to financial were not alone in the borrowing spree from to national mortgage debt almost doubled and the amount of mortgage debt per household rose more than from to even while wages were essentially stagnant the housing downturn hit heavily indebted financial and alike were the heavy debt taken on by some financial was by the risky assets they were with that debt as the mortgage and real estate out and and many financial loaded up on them the end of had billion in commercial and residential real estate and which was almost twice what it just two before and more than four times its total equity again the risk wasnt being taken on just by the big financial but by too one in mortgage in and took out option which meant they could choose to make so low that their mortgage rose every month the financial system the of this debt were because transparency was not or desired short term borrowing combined with unseen by in the market the the system could rapidly unravel the early part of the century we series of the federal as lender of last resort federal deposit insurance ample provide bulwark against the that had regularly plagued banking system in the century over the past plus we permitted the growth of shadow banking and laden with short term the size of the traditional banking system of the example the dollar market off balance sheet and the use of over the counter hidden from view without the we had to prevent financial had century financial system with century the housing and mortgage cratered the lack of transparency the extraordinary debt the short term and the risky assets all came home to roost was panic had what we had sown conclude the government was ill prepared for the crisis and its inconsistent response added to the uncertainty and panic in the financial as part of our charge it was appropriate to review government taken in response to the crisis not just those or that it to determine if any of those to or the crisis as our report key policy the federal and the federal of were best positioned to watch over our were ill prepared for the of and were also behind the curve were because they did not have clear grasp of the financial system they were with particularly as it had in the leading up to the crisis was in no small measure due to the lack of transparency in key thought risk had been diversified when in fact it had been concentrated and again from the spring of on policy and were caught off guard as the contagion spread on an ad basis with specific to put in the dike was no comprehensive and strategic plan for containment because they full understanding of the and in the financial have conceded this error had the system to race ahead of our ability to protect it there was some awareness of or at least debate about the housing bubble the record that senior public did not recognize that of the bubble could threaten the entire financial system the summer of both federal ben and henry paul son public that the turmoil in the mortgage would be hedge funds which were heavily in mortgage related in june the federal the of the collapse the fact that so many other funds were exposed to the same as those hedge funds the funds were thought to be relatively unique before the collapse of in march christopher expressed comfort about the capital at the big investment was not until august just before the government of and freddie mac that the understood the full measure of the dire financial of those two just month before collapse the federal of was still seeking information on the by more than addition the inconsistent handling of major financial during the decision to rescue and then to place and freddie mac into conservatorship by its decision not to save and then to save uncertainty and panic in the market making these we deeply respect and appreciate the made by and timothy formerly president of the federal of and now treasury secretary and so many who labored to stabilize our financial system and our economy in the most chaotic and of conclude there was systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics the integrity of our financial and the trust in those are essential to the economic well being of our nation the soundness and the sustained prosperity of the financial system and our economy rely on the of fair dealing responsibility and transparency our economy we expect and to pursue at the same time that they produce and of quality and conduct themselves well been the case in past speculative and an erosion of of responsibility and ethics that the financial crisis was not universal but these from the ground level to the corporate not only in significant financial but also in damage to the trust of and the public in the financial system for example our examination found according to one measure that the percentage of who on their within just matter of after taking loan nearly doubled from the summer of to late data they likely took out that they never had the capacity or intention to pay will read about mortgage who were yield spread by to put into higher cost so they would get bigger often never disclosed to the report the rising incidence of mortgage fraud which in an environment of and lax regulation the number of suspicious activity of possible financial by depository and their to mortgage fraud grew fold between and and then more than doubled again between and study the resulting from fraud on mortgage made between and at billion made that they knew could not afford and that could cause massive to in mortgage as early as september that many of the they were could result in catastrophic than year later they noted that certain high risk they were making could result not only in but also in financial and catastrophe for the firm they did not stop the report that major financial ineffectively they were to package and sell to knew significant percentage of the did not meet their own underwriting or those of the they sold those to the review of many provided to found that this critical information was not disclosed must be in the context of human nature and individual and societal responsibility to pin this crisis on mortal like greed and would be simplistic was the failure to account for human weakness that is relevant to this crisis we clearly believe the crisis was result of human and that in systemic for which our nation dearly as you read this report you will see that specific and irresponsibly crisis of this magnitude cannot be the work of few bad and such was not the case here the same time the breadth of this crisis does not mean that everyone is at fault many and did not participate in the that disaster do place special responsibility with the public with protecting our financial system those to run our regulatory and the chief of whose drove us to crisis sought and accepted of significant responsibility and obligation at the top does matter and in this instance we were let down no one said no as nation we must also accept responsibility for what we permitted to occur but certainly not unanimously we to or system set of and that gave rise to our present predicament and the system that our nation toward crisis the complex machinery of our financial many essential of which critical role as the crisis and we render our about specific of the system that we believe significantly to the financial conclude mortgage and the mortgage pipeline lit and spread the flame of contagion and crisis housing fell and mortgage the to dim on report the corrosion of mortgage and the pipeline that transported toxic from across america to around the globe mortgage set the bar so low that simply took eager on faith often with willful disregard for ability to pay one quarter of all made in the first half of were interest only the same year of option by and washington had low or no documentation were not secret as irresponsible predatory and fraudulent more prevalent the federal and other and from many quarters the federal its mission to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking and financial system and to protect the credit of to build the retaining wall before it was too late the of the of the and the of caught up in turf state from in many of these were kept on the bigger money came from global who to put their cash into newly mortgage related to financial and alike that risk had been the highly rated they thought were sure to perform the thought they had taken the off their and saw making and borrowing reduced each step in the mortgage pipeline on the next step to keep demand going the who to the mortgage who the to the who the to the financial that the mortgage backed debt squared and synthetic no one in this pipeline of toxic had enough skin in the game all they could off load their on notice to the next person in line were wrong stopped making mortgage the by through the pipeline as it turned out these were concentrated in set of systemically important financial the end the system that millions of so efficiently proven to be difficult to unwind complexity to so can stay in their and further uncertainty about the health of the housing market and financial conclude over the counter significantly to this crisis the enactment of legislation in to ban the regulation by both the federal and state of over the counter was key turning point in the march toward the financial crisis financial to to and to have been used to hedge against or speculate on in or indices or even on such as the potential on without any oversight rapidly spiraled out of control and out of sight growing to trillion in notional amount report the uncontrolled leverage lack of transparency capital and collateral speculation among and of risk in this market to the crisis in three significant ways one type of default the mortgage pipeline were sold to to protect against the default or decline in value of mortgage related backed by risky sold the tune of billion in in these newfangled mortgage helping to launch and expand the market and in turn to further fuel the housing bubble were essential to the creation of synthetic synthetic were merely on the performance of real mortgage related the from the collapse of the housing bubble by multiple on the same and spread them throughout the financial system alone and sold billion in synthetic from july to may by more than mortgage and of them were at least twice is apart from how many times these may have been in synthetic by other when the housing bubble and crisis were in the center of the storm which had not been to put aside capital as cushion for the protection it was selling was out when it could not meet its the government ultimately more than billion because of that collapse would trigger throughout the global financial system addition the existence of millions of of all between systemically important financial and unknown in this unregulated to uncertainty and panic helping to precipitate government assistance to those conclude the of credit rating were essential in the wheel of financial destruction the three credit rating were key of the financial the mortgage related at the heart of the crisis could not have been and sold without their seal of approval on them often blindly some they were to use them or regulatory capital were on them crisis could not have without the rating the market soar and their through and havoc across and our report you will read about the at by the as case study to rated nearly mortgage related as triple with six private sector in the that carried this rating in early alone put its triple stamp of approval on mortgage related every working day the were disastrous of the mortgage rated triple that year ultimately were will also read about the at work behind the at the flawed computer the pressure from financial that for the the relentless drive for market share the lack of to do the job despite record and the absence of meaningful public oversight you will see that without the active participation of the rating the market for mortgage related could not have been what it as to the of this crisis this regard the to address key to us we discuss three capital availability and excess liquidity the role of and freddie mac the and government housing policy as to the matter of excess liquidity in our report we outline monetary and capital during the leading up to the crisis interest widely available capital and international seeking to put their money in real estate assets in the were for the creation of credit bubble those which should have been by market policy and it is the conclusion that excess liquidity did not need to cause crisis was the outlined the failure to effectively rein in in the mortgage and financial were the principal of this crisis the availability of well priced foreign and an opportunity for economic expansion and growth if to flow in productive we the role of the with serving as the case study in this area government had deeply flawed business model as publicly with the implicit backing of and from the federal government and with public mission trillion mortgage exposure and market position were significant and they decided to ramp up their purchase and guarantee of risky just as the housing market was peaking used their political power for to ward off effective regulation and million on from to from many of the same of corporate governance and risk management as the discovered in other financial the third quarter of the had provided billion in financial support to keep them afloat conclude that these two to the crisis but were not primary cause mortgage essentially their value throughout the crisis and did not contribute to the significant financial firm that were central to the financial crisis the in the expansion of and other risky but they rather than led and other in the rush for gold the highest rated non mortgage backed and their participation in this market added helium to the housing balloon but their never majority of the market those of non mortgage backed in with the share rising to in and falling back to by relaxed their underwriting to purchase or guarantee and related in order to meet stock market and for growth to regain market share and to ensure generous compensation for their and their on the broad and sustained public policy support for the also the performance of the or by and freddie they substantial delinquency for were substantially lower than by other financial for example data by the for subset of with similar credit below show that by the end of were far less likely to be seriously delinquent than were non versus also studied at length how the of and urban affordable housing for the affected their investment in risky on the evidence and with of involved in this subject area we determined these only marginally to and participation in those as to the matter of whether government housing were primary cause of the crisis for government policy through set of assistance and were put in place and by several and both bill clinton and george set aggressive to increase home ownership our inquiry we took careful look at affordable housing as noted above and the the was in to combat by practice of credit to and in certain without regard to their the and and to lend invest and provide to the from which they take consistent with bank safety and soundness the the was not significant factor in or the crisis were not subject to the only of high cost proxy for any connection to the law made by regulated in the in which they were to lend were half as likely to default as similar made in the same by independent mortgage not subject to the law we make the following observation about government housing they in this respect as nation we set aggressive with the desire to extend credit to previously access to the financial the government to ensure that the philosophy of opportunity was being by the practical on the ground again the failure of the federal and other to rein in irresponsible peaked in the spring of and then to decline that point on the talk of opportunity was tragically at odds with the reality of financial disaster in the making its work ago some that the of and their would be well behind us by the time we this report more than two after the federal government in an unprecedented manner in our financial our country itself still grappling with the of the calamity financial system is in many still unchanged from what on the eve of the crisis in the wake of the crisis the financial sector is now more concentrated than ever in the of few large systemically significant we have not been with making policy the very purpose of our report been to take stock of what so we can plot new course our inquiry we found dramatic of corporate governance profound in regulatory oversight and fatal in our financial system also found that series of and led us toward catastrophe for which we were ill prepared are serious that must be and resolved to restore faith in our financial to avoid the next crisis and to rebuild system of capital that the foundation for new era of broadly prosperity the tragedy would be to accept the refrain that no one could have seen this coming and thus nothing could have been done we accept this notion it will happen again report should not be as the end of the examination of this crisis is

such arrangement would be permissible without the participation in accordance with through consideration of the initial it received the declined to pursue the contract rate proposal but solicited further on several broad concerning possible in the mail classification system the that its reluctance to pursue the concept of contract was based on substantial uncertainty regarding the legal

introduction of the into the usually mushy business of press responsibility that in mind hereby the henceforth to be known as the how it works that refuse to acknowledge even if to refute the importance of highly significant but inconvenient in their news or opinion coverage of controversial will score one point for the initial offense will then score one point for every subsequent issue or broadcast or posting after the first offense is noted by if they continue not to report said inconvenient fact and an additional two on days when the news organization follow up without making note of said inconvenient fact score of will be into the of that get all the way up to will be likeness of joseph would prefer not to invoke the phrase intellectual because it pompous and falsely that only can be intellectually dishonest know any other easily understandable phrase that this particular kind of offense for the of this survey the will be as separate and distinct publication from the editorial page because in essence it is the editorial page not to acknowledge that norma the friend and employee to who is one of two people partially rape accusation is the daughter of man whose murderer was by bill clinton responsible account of the whole controversy in today that the pardon had nothing to do with her corroboration the editorial page one point for failing to note the pardon in its initial ed by dorothy on it three times since the initial omission it an additional three because it an editorial taunting the rest of the press for not following it on the story and still mention the pardon it an extra two comes to total of six certain that the editorial page will provide some follow up tomorrow to tonight broadcast of its own interview which that if the editorial page to take no action it will be in the of by monday at the latest considered but the idea of bonus for eventually convinced to grant an interview to the as the in today story the does not permit any with the scoring besides on the behalf really unethical just puzzling given the two intense rivalry the bureau chief alan murray who good judgment in not breaking the story and full disclosure is former boss to comment about employee feeding to the he don really have any comment on what the edit page did do their thing we do ours is what news are instructed to say whenever the editorial page them

mail message her why she had decided to talk to the steve and reporter said caught her by surprise if thought it would be all right to talk to the reporter told her it would be certainly as all right as talking to said sorry said she would if he again this on to reporter during our second day interview chat that how it that in the piece today solemnly as eventually convinced her to repeat the story to the timothy noah and little dense for not realizing sooner that the subtext and hence much of the appeal of hillary clinton rudy race would be running against who been in to have mistress he it and by all sham marriage the first lady could exact symbolic revenge on her husband while advancing the of the party at the same time almost enough for to jump on the hillary for the media conventional wisdom is that would make hillary clinton marital major campaign issue ken look like cried this week er that be kind of risky strategy given his own problematic union have already that

she would campaign for him if he did she did say in the interview which was before the recent frenzy of speculation about hillary clinton interest in the same seat that mrs clinton is very interesting

of norma possible in of story of the three is sister whose can be similarly the other two tell her story but did not see her lip as only and husband claim to have that like every other responsible news organization that covered this story that norma father killer was by bill clinton and remains perplexed that the editorial page won is today up to seven timothy noah and the the madonna joe know what you mean about being journalist every assignment is challenge in different way and it never to get easier often feel as if only get half the story sometimes so typically do massive amount of that is most often much more than will ever need think that is why doing book it one the ability to use so much of what is left on the cutting room floor of daily journalism think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our that we never add to often recount these tales with each other and with their rather than share them with the general public of it of course the of top cannot be used since it is largely gossip we are although it certainly could make for some very good often wonder when really great fictional book will be written about this era probably and hence as it is too close any case there certainly is no lack of information available about the of technology now as they all become our current pop would posit that bill and michael and steve and jerry have become the of the current age of stock market mania and celebration of the entrepreneur the shift in the image of been an interesting one for me to watch the smart boy technologist is now being painted as the whiny bully personally always thought it was risk to pin the image of on just one man at for example there was conscious effort to develop other for lack of better word there while you think of case you also think of and and increasingly range of other steve of course is now getting lot more attention at but it still to be bill show over there did not attend the trial was lucky to be able to read your highly amusing and informative several of which made me spit up my lunch laughing it certainly as if the image of bill took beating and the insular culture of did not look so good since think it was

area they positively exciting next to all the government wonder if that geography is destiny and it still location location location where am sitting think the trial been the really obvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age think it almost does not matter what the judge does since it clear that the balance of power is shifting again although it not clear where it will land will the of the era be or one of the big media will it be none of them because the and plethora of strong and complex interconnection of where none are to dominate always use two simple when people tell me that one company whether it is or or is in charge of all our babylon was incredible empire dominated the world and imagine it did not seem possible to people living then that anyone

settle quarter century of about abortion one already restrict the abortion of viable is viable fetus is the concept of viability relevant to the moral and legal of abortion wade the case abortion made fetal viability an important legal concept the that cannot put the of fetus ahead of the of the pregnant woman until the fetus is viable the court defined viable to mean capable of life outside the mother womb said this included that to be sustained by the court accepted the conventional medical wisdom that fetus becomes viable at the start of the last third of pregnancy the third trimester sometime between the th and th week pregnancy usually the point of viability the court it could only be determined case by case and by the woman own doctor if the fetus is viable the court said could not outlaw an abortion if the woman life or health was at stake sandra in decision that was on collision course with itself said that in technology would continually push the point of fetal viability closer to the beginning of the pregnancy greater opportunity to regulate the right to an abortion this to be the case up to point now believe fetus can become viable during the week week than was

made viability even more important the court said that state could require woman and her doctor to perform to prove that fetus is not viable before she an abortion one now have post viability allow to decide for themselves if the fetus is viable require to perform to prove fetus is viable and require multiple to certify the have the procedure intact dilation and extraction also known as partial birth abortion in the belief that this procedure is used mainly post viability nationwide is major goal of the pro life movement claim that the procedure in which delivery is induced the fetus skull is crushed and its brains are to infanticide this procedure is also the only regulation of abortion that public opinion say majority of support say the ban on is inconsistent with because the procedure can be used to abort viable medical and constitutional say that the was wrong to create the viability post viability distinction in the first place they ask does the fact that fetus can

teens memory is rickety but am sure my first recording was and think though am less sure that it was by the late who was to my mind one of the of jazz got another recording of the same tune this one by think the label said thought that was surely the first time had ever seen such an obvious typographical error in of all simple title on simple record remember was in my youth and it was time when typographical were typographical not least by in junior high time later got still another version of with still another version of the title time it was thought was really absurd only had they left out the they the to it made no sense at all the other hand reasoned if there were in fact some sort of cat muscat perhaps it so outrageous up muscat in my and found that it is variety of grape name ramble after variety of grape to me preposterous was young and by today at least pathetically innocent my time in senior high and after that in the had other on my mind there was war on after all and give the problem any thought of my time in the which was utterly undistinguished think must make confession might be as good time as any to reveal theft at an seymour indiana was winter and bitterly cold the wind used to sweep across that damned airfield with what an absolute determination to crystallize our day when the wind chill factor was absolute zero took shelter in the service club was the omnipresent phonograph or vic short for victrola and the stack of next to it those days people as rule did not take much care of phonograph the were taken from their and loaded naked in where they picked up dust one another and static electricity was shuffling through stack of about fifty and came across three bessie all three and the few other in the room which was quite enough for fair sized

gilbert is that find him listed as author of thirty ago when was an dish and saw that had no sherry on hand went to the liquor store and bought bottle of muscatel that was being sold for an absurdly low price and that thought might be exactly right for my sauce bad the wine my back to is made from muscat is sometimes muscat and being relatively cheap and sweet and high in alcohol content is the booze of choice for great many old college friend of mine who celebrated his twentieth twenty of couple of ago me that when he was on the and riding the from drunk tank to drunk tank the favorite for muscat were and smoke made up my mind that was almost certainly the original name of the tune reasoning is that it is not likely that or ray gilbert had ever seen muskrat and it even less likely that they or anyone else ever seen muskrat doing anything that we would be likely to think of as rambling according to my encyclopedia look like giant are found in and around the bordering and quiet have partially webbed and do good deal of swimming do not appear to do much rambling or muscatel on the other hand is found on skid all over the land guy with bottle shaped brown paper bag damp and wrinkled at its upper end almost certainly been slugging down sweet wine of high proof and the odds are pretty good you would find it is the guy his smoke and slept it off he is looking for the to get another muscat fix he is on ramble with his hand out and pleading look in his suspect that that is precisely the song origin theory is that the got put in there simply because muskrat is more common word than muscat is the same reason most of us assume have in the hospital with prostrate trouble is more common word that prostate so prostrate is what we get the in naturally got strange sort of corroboration from my good friend who is now pushing eighty seven and spent most of his life clarinet and sax with some of the best red ted and slew of too had seen the tune as and him what he thought the original title was had known well and he said know tom not exactly sure once about it and he said think that just the way everyone said muscat you are find muskrat ramble difficult to imagine visually picture about in the mire and paddling sluggishly through the water but call that rambling the other hand with an empty paper bag on ramble to maintain his muscat that touch of poetry not in the same class with all the sing bass but poetry nevertheless as nonexpert although interested subscriber to it is bit mysterious to me that the singular noun absence the plural verb are refer to the

modern archaeology to have close behind for the excavation of the supposed site of troy took place only about ago it is just as well for only by the available to modern science are we now able to

the reconstruction of ancient the we have from early that had writing system are relatively sparse latin and greek hebrew and few other are better than but for most all we have to go on are handful of here few there barely enough in many to allow us to identify the language let alone draw any regarding its structure or meaning one day we shall find an etruscan library buried deep in the italian countryside but for the present we have to make do with what we have which is precious little that had no writing system we know nothing at all some very clever comparative beginning in in the century about how the nature of the of the more modern some ancient have been some from multilingual the work of jean francois in from the rosetta stone was an astonishing accomplishment for it us to read the myriad of the ancient on papyrus and in wall and revealed an enormous amount of the knowledge we have today about their civilization which for about significant break through was that of michael who the script found on crete and it as an early form of greek the standpoint of language work was more important particularly because it filled in gap in our knowledge of the early of european ago linguistic scholar all of the then spoken of which he had evidence the total was approximately but that is probably only vague estimate he undoubtedly some some have sprung up since his time modern hebrew for instance and some have the exact count is unimportant and at best spurious for it is extremely difficult to establish uniform criteria for what dialect from language too one must examine the used to group the many of the world examining greek latin german english slavic swedish norwegian danish dutch lithuanian iranian hindi and the other of india and found that there were among many

synonymy in language does not yield to the commutative law of mathematics in language equal to the same thing are not necessarily equal to each other the people thought that they had got round that little problem by giving the same definition for each of the in the list but we know that only very rarely are two unique which is another way of saying that if does not necessarily always equal an

on chair just past the foot of his bed and walking toward the case that gun man can only hope to leave the world better place than when he came into it have let loose terrible plague upon the can only rest when the scourge been you responsible for san diego john and were the rex and from what read in the paper they beast capable of killing the rex your fault it interrupting we have to finish it jeffrey please regret nothing from my life except that thinking for moment before the case won be easy getting there have access to all of my seem to have no need for money me one thing can do will don go anywhere until bring you the trophy toward the door he turns and at who is smiling weakly and the door behind him with wide shot of the cemetery single umbrella carrying individual up the hill to join the funeral under an awning can see his face but he his way over to two other standing apart from the main group who we only see from the back the man and off his umbrella it is the other two people and turn to look at him whispered grant whispered malcolm whispered ian any trouble getting in the rain the flight from the head of the congregation us go now not in sadness but rejoicing in the knowledge that our husband our father our grandfather and our friend been eternal salvation and place where he may walk with the in amen the congregation with an amen and there is great shuffling of and as the get up to leave the bagpiper again grace as toward the casket to casket john for the first time in long time don know what to say and have never been on particularly good and regret not burying that hatchet while you were still alive but at the same time can help but think that your passing sense of closure to twelve of horror ah that not what meant to say better just leave it as john single rose from inside of his jacket and on the coffin back toward and but the camera down to the headstone which to your still seem entirely real is strange to think of how many that he was partly responsible for and it only catching up to him now never really anyone to die was just so intent on making history that he forgot the human cost could be devastating from behind grant and malcolm that us samuel executor of mr estate we were drawing up his final will he me to make sure you in person left us something message is it it few before his death to show it to the three of you as soon as possible into his coat pocket and out business you like to stop by my office tomorrow and know you re all very busy so be more than happy to finish this up as soon as possible the san diego incident lot of my credibility was no longer lunatic who had seen with bunch of other people who that re really sorry we back you up about the park was just so much at stake research money had been

the sound on live breaking news story in the video camera between the reporter and large footprint in the wet beach sand as you can see by the size of this impression this is very large creature estimate its length at about forty of fifty with gigantic tooth filled in broken english the thing was laying on the beach when woke up this morning of the dogs from the neighborhood ran up to it and barking the lizard woke up and made horrible noise the whole village shook the creature roar brought many curious out of their it caught sight of them it range anywhere from half dozen to twenty or more for the camera to point toward military in the background as you can see behind me the have already they were engaging in training the when word of this broke it is not clear what the strategy here will be it is clear that they are not the threat on tank god re on the no it john you knew this could happen back to the screen walking toward group of armored re being told to clear the area so we re heading into an area the have safe wont be able to broadcast live feed from the area so until we re clear this is live in and for safe return are with you now we have just received amateur footage of the attack and we re going to roll that for you now grainy video at early dawn two legged dinosaur tearing open car and disappearing into the jungle this was taken by an amateur cameraman in sometime in the dawn of this morning the picture quality good but you can clearly see what can only be as dinosaur car back to the course we haven seen anything like this since the incident in san diego when tyrannosaurus rex by got loose and went on rampage through the city this really happening and are all glued to the when there is knock at the door not really paying attention young officer into the office to bother you sir was sent for alan grant and ian malcolm us do you need need to come with me sir my are to bring you to the base course sorry just that lot in such short time and think we re all just going to need little time to put it all together sir know you might feel that way right now but have been ordered to bring you with me without delay afraid have to agree with grant here sir there are two officer waiting in the hall and two more outside to place you under arrest if you don come with me right now ian it like we better go whispering to go to and find need to know everything we can about whatever this thing is think this something to do with the incident in bet my bottom dollar up to press button on his left shoulder recording to the microphone day fourteen have been on this island for two and seen no sign of either the rex or the have been to all of the that the were said to frequent but without avail am out of food and set to meet the helicopter at the meeting point in twelve regret that am coming home from this hunt empty handed jurassic chris as the helicopter and debark the chopper off again as them the vehicle and up to them over the helicopter grant malcolm welcome to and in command of this little fiasco we had to drag you here so abruptly but you know what they say about desperate times are we here need you help grant you follow me and down to the beach never seen anything like this wager no one save you two and handful of know what to make of it at first and how to preserve the specimen was bit ambiguous but one of our was big paleontology nut and had read all about you and your work and how to preserve delicate to rig something up to protect the sample from the until you could arrive to make the positive identification why am here seen firsthand how dinosaur in an urban environment you re talking about san diego can assure you that this area is substantially different do you mean saw was dinosaur in highly downtown area with nowhere to hide is small village with dense jungle on all sides might as well be back on the island you did see the on the the you are uniquely familiar with the of with people but sure grant is much more of an asset than am ian have been brought into dinosaur area to provide advice not competent to give only one is way too many know that of your malcolm you re here the government have brought you into this area unless it felt you would be an asset the three of them arrive at large tarp covered square we are let get this thing up few lift the frame up and out revealing large footprint do you make of that grant low and the trackway rising tell you for sure but it bit bigger than the rex seen another gigantic predator say it probably the call the for soldier to set up the equipment to contact the and away from and we it on we said the were territorial it might be that the had it hunting area in the between our little read much of anything on your misadventure on the decided to let me have the movie as compensation for shall we say was actually working with in when john reason you bring me in on this god tried ian re hard man to track down the are as much yours as they are mine only accepted the offer to help fund the research we re doing in montana movie about you think the public will buy that the conversation is interrupted by helicopter flying low toward the beach shout as they hurry to cover the footprint and look toward who is shouting in megaphone through the megaphone pilot this is no fly zone are not authorized to land here return to your point of origin immediately the helicopter down on the sand and man out of the rear door is carrying large duffel bag and wearing khaki trousers khaki shirt and black ball cap the man the door closed on it with his fist and skyward the chopper off as the man is surrounded by and the hell is this me pointing toward the circle of and the man think he going over to greet the newcomer the man is now facing away from and is at and on his with his behind his head and jog over to the site of the commotion the man who his behind his back is being lead over to shouting at who the hell are you and what the hell do you think you re doing name is jeffery clark been hunting on an island off the coast and to re supply your pilot hear the radio is no fly zone no one in and no one out must have been mistake we thought this was some sort of market can be serious it really matter here now and be on my way back to the island just as soon as buy some food no you re not are under arrest for military order insignia do you really have the to hold me me mr clark was it island were you hunting on since it like already in trouble it can hurt to tell you was on were hunting sarcastically no is well known for its penguin population are you ian malcolm know you no you knew my uncle roland say knew him that well is he doing by the way well afraid the only reason here and he not mr clark you have just into very dangerous area as much as hate it you are stuck here until the beast is beast the snapping at grant about the about the on the island either many are we talking about here as far as knew there were only three and the baby and one of them was by the while was on the island there might be two more on the can just jump to that conclusion right could be thousand you see the on the island the the other two in the interim since he the first one maybe they swam for it and the fact is we don know and we draw that might further disturb the public toward sir from is it attack no sir another footprint been found print no sir smaller sir are the the shrunk up mr clark grant could the have been made by the same animal possible where is sir about fifteen or twenty up the coast imagine it technically possible rex moving at full speed was clocked at thirty some per hour the had slightly longer gait so put it normal walking speed at about ten maybe fifteen per hour and that would put him there within an hour of leaving here and it was last seen almost six ago had plenty of time to get up there sir we have reason to believe the were made less than an hour ago the print position and the tide it have been made more than forty five ago jesus forty five ago fifty now sir what the size difference sir think we have to consider the possibility that there is second dinosaur in thinking then sighing get on the horn notify all of the second dinosaur sir leaves three stay here going to call washington and break the news to them to his would you mind for to unlock about my bag still being get it back when we re satisfied that you re no longer threat the mean time stay put off toward tent phone calling from the shot between each speaker as they talk alan grant alan it are you doing have you found out found was less than willing to be helpful but to glean few the what about the as it turns out the was one of the first bred on the island there was mix up in the lab and they instead of how does that help us worse actually the and the were both for the lysine contingency but the system perfected until the next set of were what are you saying alan the and the don need supplemental to survive can make their own lysine how can we stop them don know but please be careful will back toward and did she find out walking back from the tent the head researcher at of told her that the and the were not bred lysine deficient that what to us the can exist eating non lysine food mean whatever they can find afraid so came down here to hunt the rex and will do so if you let me mr clark can in good conscience let go on his own when there are not one but two dangerous still running amok if there in this are let you leave with enough firepower to engage small armored division you talking about my uncle elephant gun or my rifle jesus clark it fifty caliber anti material rifle not your everyday deer gun hunting something little bigger than deer can tell you that minute still don know why the came here but if the relationship between the two species is the same we can assume why the rex came too think the rex is chasing the read sarah book about the of the they your because you took their infant imagine what they have done if you had it the the baby rex and goes out looking for revenge would it have even tracked it smell the rex was only few behind the could very easily have left at nearly the same time the question still remains how do we find them think it pretty clear that we seal off either one of them south of we never find them in the amazon that these swam two hundred to get here think it safe to say they could swim from here to south america without much difficulty need to find one of them we find the rex it will lead us to the we find the the rex will come to us we have to figure out more secure method for them an ocean is no obstacle grant the official position is to neutralize the threat as quickly as possible are you talking about neutralize alan these can be overcome every security obstacle people have put in their way we build better cage they are just going to break out again and again know my dislike of john was just as strong as yours but he was right ian are the only people who can protect the and the island creation may have been in lab but their are real many will it take alan many people have to end up as dinner for these before they become the good of the world is on the line we have to sacrifice the good of our do we do that them for people have right to play god by them we certainly don have right to play god by causing another extinction if you please don have time for philosophical debate here we can contain the we give it try but my are to stabilize the area any and all necessary grant was right about how to find them we can follow the rex he lead us right to the but it will be hard to remain inconspicuous if we follow him with an army suggest that we send one person to track him as to who the one person might be the person who been out to get the rex from day one he half the his uncle is then he should have no problem you feel up to it course am provided get my back see about that

much in need of that of of the of new territory is tentative and incomplete pointing but not fully adequate persistently hope it is better to light one candle against what the darkness the veil beyond which we have had no framework of before are grounds reasoned about by the best of and of the past several to doubt physics of semantics are on shaky ground when the first hard frost comes when the have been swung their crimson leaves scattered carelessly when splint shallow and old stand dark watch the coming dawn long legged knowing how winter is thin when the first phase transition of water to ice slight solidity across meadow small of flesh and concept tiptoe gingerly to some far side where perhaps something new is to be found have physical definition of an autonomous agent able to manipulate the universe on its own egret whose foreboding of winter to wing and steady powerful flight the egret is as much part of physical reality as the atom and perhaps more than the vaunted quark autonomous we who do daily manipulate the world on our own behalf we to whom intentionality and purpose are so inevitably by our common we are by my definition of autonomous also nothing but physical with peculiar organization of and the concept of autonomous were something like more of life itself then autonomous span the gap from the merely physical to that new realm of the merely physical where purpose is by all of us to one another with purpose for this to be true it is not necessary that the of purpose say the same bacterium heading upstream in the glucose gradient be conscious hope my definition of an autonomous agent is useful an autocatalytic system carrying out work cycle now rather by the realization that autonomous also do often detect and measure and record of external from equilibrium that can be used to extract work then do extract work work and constraint construction from their environment how ourselves and objectively back three billion to the mixed microbial community flourishing right about where most of us are now plus or minus modicum of of surface crustal material want to say that the autonomous that community had individually and collectively the know how to get on with making living in the natural that their world as have before biosphere is self consistent of autonomous ways of making living and the search mutation recombination as well as behavioral search open to autonomous those of making living that were well out and by the and their search the of that were widely filled the abundant of the sphere is in this whole self system know how beyond the know how of any single autonomous agent spinning eagerly in its clearly the know how is distributed is no autonomous agent no one who how the whole system works any more than anyone at present how the global economic system works in its myriad and in the world is know how distinguish between know how and know that know how to tie my and am learning how to play jazz that most conveniently human know that the moon tell made of green cheese know that the earth the sun that the earth is roughly spherical that are used to sit on that with it the standard and nonstandard of the truth or falseness of as they report of the world higher who are trained to manipulate simple with apparent reference to the world also can know that with respect to know that know how does not involve about the world how procedural knowledge about how to get on in the world the cheetah after the wildebeest the athletic genius high have the know how to do it bacterium know how to make living in its world certainly want to say yes without consciousness in any way the myriad subtle on and of metabolic switching mechanical of glucose gradient swimming and tumbling upstream to higher glucose how all right even if it cannot talk about how it on with its business then try to talk about tying your or the skilled driving when you become aware some of down the road that you have accomplished the without paying the attention god for know how that is thin veneer on four billion year old know how skill abundant in the biosphere any autonomous agent alone or in of other it would seem is also by the selfsame know how we synthesize autonomous in the next and they under our rapt gaze over or into modestly complex ecosystem brimming with novel life they too will know how to make living in their mutually world plus the boundary we more or less intelligently impose on them the know how is in these nothing but another view of the of catalysis work recording and acting that we now recognize as inherent in the doings of autonomous the know how is not outside that organization the know how is the organization of which us inevitably to the brink of semantics is simple at its you see incoming molecular species in the interior of an autonomous agent really is food poison signal neutral something else there is an autonomous agent there is semantics from its privileged point of view the incoming molecule is yuck or think the major conceptual step to yuck or is unavoidable once there is an autonomous agent think we have roughly the darwinian criteria in mind then there will probably be more of this type of agent of the first yuck it is not so likely this lineage will prosper yuck and we are not far from pierce meaning laden semiotic triad sign it or not the glucose gradient is sign predictor of more glucose that way the glucose is not an arbitrary symbol any more than cloud is an arbitrary symbol of rain this restricted sense are causally correlated with that which is contrast the relation between the word chair and that which it and on which am now sitting is arbitrary can chemical in bacterial and plant and human be arbitrary from chemical causal point of view so can mere be in the full sense believe it is clear that mere chemistry in an autonomous agent can harbor and in the full of the first the famous genetic code of in an molecule stand for specific amino that will end up incorporated into protein the detailed causal machinery transfer with their site and the distant site to which amino are attached the that charge the amino acid binding site of each transfer with the proper amino acid among the twenty amino the binding of the transfer site to the proper code word triplet the that between adjacent transfer and links the successive amino into the growing polypeptide chain that free in the cytoplasm by the to the messenger molecule as it is the arbitrariness of the genetic code is by the evolution of novel transfer which translate given messenger code word triplet into amino acid as properly three ago in slightly context concerning activation and inhibition of at on the enzyme that are distant from the catalytic site the relation of chemical that achieve control of catalysis are utterly arbitrary with respect to the chemical that undergo the catalysis the same is true of the transfer where the site is distant from the amino acid binding site of this which amino acid is onto particular transfer is utterly arbitrary and by the enzyme that does the charging plus the structure of the amino acid binding site on the transfer of these can be without the codon matching mechanism short chemistry arbitrary of control fully legitimate to assign the of sign and to the genetic code legitimate to extend that notion to much of the subtle chemical and otherwise within and between autonomous as by that upon infestation by particular insect secrete secondary metabolite chemical that other of the same species that an insect infestation is happening and to turn on defensive anti insect secondary the calculus that is claude shannon elegant information theory always been about reduction of uncertainty about the statistics of the source of set of in the core of shannon work concerning the and transmission of information does the meaning or semantics of the information enter is no criticism and is widely known and is however just hint of semantics in shannon view that the semantics in the cannot buy shannon view unless the is an autonomous agent not then the merely bit string sent along communication channel into some other discrete or continuous set of water filled bowls is drained by turning on machine that between the bowls and to the outside world in particular ways the of bowl drainage upon receipt of the binary string sent along the communication channel the if the recipient is an autonomous agent such as bacterium and the incoming molecule is symbol sign of or an amoeba on the roam and the bacterium away and becoming dinner that sequence of laden with semantics only the bacterium could tell us you see that truck of coming at me run into that one before under boulder and he never sensed me made it home me some more glucose please martha will return in the next chapter to discuss such for will say that we cannot prestate the configuration space of biosphere and therefore cannot deduce that which will unfold among other we must tell to understand the of in their not be overly quick to accuse me of too know the the common claim that we can always in principle translate from intentional talk to the fully predictive causal account of the in question patience only are we unable to prestate the configuration space of biosphere and predict what will unfold but we also cannot even the sense of necessary and legal talk to normal intentional talk let alone from legal talk of found guilty of murder to physical talk about sound wave and at space time as description let just be naive for the moment the semantics of the yuck or coming into simple autonomous an early somehow linked with the know how of that agent in making living or failing to make living in its world the semantics of an event is some subset of the fully context dependent set of causal of the event or signal in question for want of nail the shoe was lost for want of the shoe the horse was lost and for want of the horse the rider was lost more or less said benjamin franklin the semantics of the nail is some subset of this context dependent set of of the event or signal in question to the autonomous in the system hard to ascribe purpose in the sense of acting on its own behalf to stone or chair and easy with respect to an alga course there is sense in which my attribution of semantics to autonomous is purely tautological all by that bacterium swimming upstream in the glucose gradient was acting on its own behalf in an environment defined an autonomous agent as physical system able to act on its own behalf then what physical system must be such that it can act on its own behalf five later it is hardly an independent deduction that autonomous are the organization of matter energy and organization to which can be in the sense of being able to act on their own behalf definition is definitional circle the other hand while the definition is circular like and natural selection and fitness that does not mean that the set of surrounding my definition of an autonomous agent as system that does work cycle to touch the real world and are not by my definition autonomous living are the stunning fact directly before us every day is that autonomous do manipulate the world on their own behalf pair of build their nest short once we have autonomous and yuck and it that semantics the universe as the and behave on their own behalf with one another in the unfolding of biosphere about knowing daniel in his fine book hierarchy of of knowing if may use that term that have arisen in evolution by darwinian find his hierarchy congenial and informative evolution as sequence of of construction that bit by bit build up higher order via variation and natural selection do not disagree although have far greater emphasis on the of self organization in evolution in am trying to point at the mysterious but utterly natural hopefulness in which an increasing diversity of broken in the universe the diversity of and that can constitute and identify ramified and of energy detect those of energy create and that couple to those of energy and generate yet more diversity that macroscopic order even further wonder in short at the naturalness and self of building building in perhaps planetary and beyond back to the past darwinian and gregorian simple autonomous agent say bacterium is darwinian creature its version the creature by mutation also recombination and natural selection for the moment no behavioral learning is to be considered one or colony or an ecosystem of darwinian more or less as told us the next level up say nervous system is present and the creature is capable of stimulus response learning la can learn very simple conditioned later analogue is the bell causing the dog to salivate in expectation of food the next level perhaps properly this for us is the creature in fine phrase have internal of their world and can run the internal model with the clutch disengaged rather than running the model in real time in the real world us lucky to allow our hypotheses to die in our stead love that image the is the gregorian at least the wonderful argument that we utilize our stone digging sticks machine enlarge our world of and enlarged world us more know how and more know that evolution at some point to burst out of rock music the of iran what new cultural will blossom chinese cooking in cuba and cuban chinese cuisine is next under the sun can say very much like ladder of know how and eventual know that consciousness not because it is not worth but because so little sensible ever been said on the subject it worth how much of this hierarchy could be by simple molecular even without nerve would think lot of this hierarchy could find molecular for example bacteria and amoebae do have kind of learning already for they have that accommodate to constant level of given signal and sense instead change from the current level is not yet the association of more or less arbitrary conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus but can imagine chemistry to accomplish the latter as are supposed to proliferate and form novel synaptic that survive if used and to mediate the linkage of conditioned to unconditioned stimulus why not envision complex chemistry say very complex carbohydrate synthesis sustained by complex of whose are by the themselves which is true of contemporary carbohydrate metabolism system might blindly try out variant of synthesis until it could establish self sustaining web linking the the and certain protein mediating the linkage between unconditioned and conditioned stimulus then maintain that linkage by positive feedback the image is not too far from how it is that idiotype and anti idiotype immune work to sustain synthesis of set of desired against an incoming pathogen such for which there is modestly good evidence given first antibody as an antigen that the body to produce second antibody that to the unique amino acid the idiotype of the first antibody turn the second anti idiotype antibody third which fourth this series is likely to form feedback because the first and third antibody can often both bind to the same site on the second antibody hence the first and third are similar in shape space is not much of stretch to think of the immune system as conditioned stimulus response system cannot the molecular and hypothesis testing churning of the bacterium as it churn twenty before kicking in the rotary motor or not such that the wee bacterium under boulder of grain of sand until the beast by necessary as noted are said to signal one another with complex secondary to characterize the particular of the glade are arbitrary structural between the metabolite and the insect just as in human language are often arbitrary with respect to the bad for nerveless do get stuck at gregorian here the free and open of new symbol in language wherever new can be is not that fundamentally from the persistent open creation of new of in the biosphere as whole the conversation we recent two legged are with respect to our digging sticks and atomic is impressive so too is the chemical conversation in any full ecosystem where we are all instrumental in the of one another suppose am naively driven to consider that the biosphere with its urgent diversity in which by all our know how we do get on with very rich conversation may very early already have all the of which are just more gregarious with our vocal and mail guess place biosphere lots to talk about billion of comedy may have long time ago what of ethics whiff of ethical issue arise with autonomous or from my point of view if am an autonomous agent are deep for caution hume told us long ago about the naturalistic fallacy cannot deduce ought from is the fact that care for their young we cannot deduce that they ought to do so hume the fact that set out to conquer and more and to kill jewry we cannot deduce that he ought to have done so hume injunction the caution of about making ethical find the across the globe can argue the ethics if hume us not to deduce ought from is where do come from at all hume injunction against deduction from is to ought nevertheless by the legitimacy of the category ought the following hume to understand the meaning of ethical have been long twisted arduous the of the logical of the vienna that only those capable of verification were meaningful as famous as moore came to wonder if ethical were merely emotive is wrong to kill the positivist argument seem persuasive always amused me that the core injunction of the logical only those that are verifiable are meaningful is itself not verifiable is of something about hoisting and john of harvard eloquently that our human of fairness derive from what we would all contractually agree to were we to know before birth that we would all be born with and equality before the law is one contract that to us before the law is far more refined than the yuck or of the bacterium the emergence of ethics in the evolution of life on this planet is fascinating issue will content myself with wondering where value and the of intentionality come from in the physical universe in the first place and leave social for other is the place of value in world of fact short soliloquy are know that know how know that fully aware of hume injunction think that from the autonomous agent perspective yuck or is primary unavoidable and of the importance to that agent suppose we apply the darwinian criteria much yuck this one and its progeny are gone from the future of the biosphere consciousness to an coli or an autonomous agent we may create in the future cannot help but feel that the of value are present once autonomous are around again without consciousness once an autonomous agent is around is the rudiment of intentionality present so another cornerstone of ethical activity been laid behavior first the logical possibility of behavior for which one is responsible are not responsible for and beyond your control act ethically you must first be able to act at all what are in the first place daniel is brilliant young mathematician entering harvard dan spent summer with me at the santa before he learned to drive after an summer spent in the laboratory of jack at harvard where at age fourteen dan was learning to evolve to bind arbitrary dan and that summer to make the distinction between the doings of an autonomous agent and mere in and around the autonomous agent we say the coli is swimming upstream in the glucose gradient to get dinner all of molecular vibrational rotational and translational are are and what are mere do not think we were successful in drawing clean distinction between doings and with clear mathematics sense that the distinction between doings and dan happy phrasing is relevant for coli us and autonomous in general will meet similar problem in the next chapter when we attempt to distinguish between the function of part of an organism and the other causal of that part of the organism and interesting is it not that these all seem to arise with autonomous but not otherwise that we here seem to confront the language game circularity to yet do truly think that the of semantics intentionality value and ethics arise with autonomous do not think those to jump over hume naturalistic fallacy cannot deduce ought from is in any concrete context but think we have the of ought and is in the physical universe once we have autonomous style of suit worn by african filipino and mexican during the and culture this style of dress is primarily associated with the of the the fashion at that time was to wear very baggy pants with pegged long with high and sharp shoulder thick and long watch dangling from the belt addition to the whole style common to was particular haircut long with and wide brimmed hat the word was known within the urban jazz culture of and it meant something either exaggerated in performance or in style african wore an extravagant style of clothing the baggy pegged pants and with that later known as the suit the novel by ralph he the style walking slowly their swaying their swinging from their in trousers that upward from fitting snug about their their long and hip tight with far too broad to be those of natural western men the late night jazz of this style was killer coat with drape shape and like cell tyler the point that the suit was an extremely symbolic costume which gave the wearer the look of child in adult clothing the

and river response specific of on alluvial can be brief review of of tectonic activity of and river response will be background material the stage for detailed that follow of deformation the surficial in an alluvial valley can take different as in the displacement can be seismic and associated with and abrupt faulting or it can be aseismic with progressive tilting and warping of the valley floor may be lateral that displace or offset the channel without vertical displacement type of displacement should be easily with vertical displacement may have the uplifted block upstream of the fault with the result that gradient is the opposite case the gradient will be the effect will resemble monoclinal tilting of may produce uplifted horst or graben that will both steepen and reduce gradient the same effect as and or and addition to all of these structural the entire valley may be upstream or downstream or the tilting may be across the valley toward either side of the the are great but in reality the result will be local or reduction of gradient or cross valley tilting respond to vertical displacement along and by aggradation or degradation the displacement channel segment steeper than the original stream gradient erosion will be in this reach the displacement channel segment of lower elevation or gradient than the original stream aggradation will occur small may be sufficient to induce aggradation or degradation of large the displacement dam the stream will be blocked and it will flow along the fault or form lake that even few of vertical upthrow along the downstream side of fault can produce dam across small stream which can divert its course deformation by faulting folding and lateral tilting view on left cross section on right from small indicate direction of flow indicate direction of movement the displacement in each case is greatly exaggerated horst and graben and combine two different of vertical displacement and will be aggradation upstream from the horst and degradation which will migrate upstream on the downstream part of the horst sediment supply because of aggradation upstream will enhance the downstream degradation of the graben there will be degradation and aggradation in the graben itself river in such location will be unstable as cartier and for the in montana the type of folding will affect river similar to the various of faulting but will probably be less abrupt the effects of tilting will depend upon the amount but in the case of valley will cause degradation and reverse tilt will cause deposition tilting will cause channel shift or avulsion only simple but exaggerated whereas actual can be more complicated for example can take any angle from parallel to perpendicular to river flow direction of the surface at the time of an earthquake are obvious and its influence on alluvial can be for example small stream have been offset by strike slip movement of the san andreas fault pointed out that the offset of stream channel on the relative of fluvial and tectonic the main reason why channel offset by the san andreas fault is clear is the extremely high rate of displacement along the fault year and and the relatively small size of crossing and flowing along the fault fault are obvious of the land surface by folding can be slow this type of deformation can also be an important influence on river behavior for example concentration of erosion along only one river bank can be the result of lateral tilt and alexander of alluvial is apparent that different of alluvial will respond differently to deformation therefore their must be before their response can be can best be done by simple classification of alluvial that is based on type of sediment load and pattern basic channel exist straight with either sand or with alternate forming sinuous two of highly sinuous channel of equal width pattern and that are at than in pattern the transition and typical braided stream the relative stability of these in of their normal erosional activity and the shape and gradient of the as related to relative sediment size load velocity of flow and stream power are also in been possible to develop these experimentally by the gradient sediment load stream power and the type of sediment load transported by the channel and alluvial have also been classified according to the type of sediment load moving through the as suspended load mixed load and bed load discharge the of the channel width depth meander but the relative of bed load sand and gravel and suspended load and determine not only the shape of the channel but ratio and channel pattern suspended load channel been defined as one that less than percent bed load and bed load channel as one transporting more than percent bed load the mixed load channel between these two classification based on pattern and type of sediment load with associated and relative stability that transport clay silt sand and gravel can be within these three general within the stream group there is considerable range of sinuosity to addition in the braided stream category there are bar braided and island braided are that the range of from straight to braided continuum but experimental work and field have that the of pattern between braided and straight occur relatively abruptly at river pattern the pattern take place at critical of stream power gradient and sediment load and between flume slope and sinuosity during at constant water discharge load stream power velocity increase with flume slope and similar relation can be with these from and the five of involve all three river there are five basic bed load channel that have been during experimental of channel five basic bed load channel can be extended to mixed load and suspended load to produce river are bed load channel are mixed load channel and are suspended load channel to show sinuosity and how the pattern change with increasing valley slope stream power and sediment load for each channel type the three major river are by type of sediment load but within each type the different reflect valley slope sediment load and stream power the different bed load channel can be as straight essentially equal width channel with sand alternate bar channel with side or alternate and slightly sinuous low sinuosity channel with large alternate that develop transitional braided channel the large alternate or point have been dissected by but can be is typical bar braided channel as to the bed load the five mixed load are relatively narrower and and there is greater bank stability the higher degree of bank stability the maintenance of narrow deep straight and alternate stabilize because of the finer to form slightly sinuous is truly channel wide on the relatively narrow at the and subject to chute the sinuosity of channel but with greater sediment transport the presence of it composite sinuous braided appearance is braided channel that is relatively more stable than that of bed load channel and it is likely to be island braided the range of alluvial channel for the three channel bed load channel mixed load channel suspended load channel from load are narrow and than mixed load load is straight narrow deep channel only small of bed load this type of channel may have the highest sinuosity of all and may undergo metamorphosis during which the channel morphology completely is suspended load channel could become braided or braided channel could become or when there is sufficiently great change in the type of sediment load transported through that channel the change from one type of channel pattern to another may be relatively common as the nature of the sediment through the system and this may be the effect of tributary sediment or upstream degradation or aggradation or tectonics is an additional channel pattern that the range of stream of is the pattern of branching and channel al the channel can be straight or braided and they appear to span the range of channel or differ from braided because they are composed of multiple that are by whereas braided have multiple in single channel and and al suggest that this pattern is to single channel because appear to be associated with partly blocked and and tectonic uplift gregory and gradient from whatever cause to be important and therefore of river can be evidence of tectonic activity of deformation the first geomorphic of active tectonics may be tectonic that result from long continued deformation such as drainage and deformed of obvious are in contrast to the more subtle of alluvial the arrangement of and into drainage network is affected by the regional slope of the surface on which the pattern climate and the of the surface material in both slope and will cause in the drainage pattern for example experimental that parallel drainage form on greater than about percent whereas dendritic form on and of of and king indicate relative of and of from to from al in regional surface slope can cause anomalous drainage topographic high by active uplift will cause deflection of of the drainage pattern for instance on the upslope side of an uplift the local surface slope will be opposite that of the regional slope can cause of the drainage pattern to develop in direction opposite to that of the drainage network uplift may also deflect of the drainage from the general direction of the regional slope as the major are deflected away from the uplift on one side will be and those on the other side will be of an entire drainage network as result of tilting are by who that isostatic adjustment in

excellent indication of recent deformation along of the of california only are deformed but as an uplift is crossed can be converted to low terrace will of course dramatically alter the hydraulics and hydrology of the reach addition to the obvious evidence of deformation above evidence of deformation is provided by alluvial and al al by in of of different and vincent and and by of valley and river

show dramatic of pattern trend and gradient that cannot be to other and petroleum have known for that are strong of faulting howard activity can significantly control river and behavior and this is especially true of alluvial and state that can be reflected only in those geomorphic that react to the of slope such as meander addition the of thickness and distribution of recent indicate the variability of tectonics in given valley one of the most sensitive of change is the valley floor profile and longitudinal profile of stream al will be very sensitive of valley slope change order to maintain constant gradient river that is being by downstream tilt will increase its sinuosity or braid whereas reduction of valley slope will lead to reduction of sinuosity or aggradation if the pattern cannot change for example that both the and have to braided pattern as result of the of their gradient by the in northern australia and the red canada is as result of reduction of gradient by isostatic rebound are provided by the mississippi between louis and cairo and the lower missouri as well as the red of the canada and can also resemble the effects of active tectonics and can provide information on channel change for example if sea level is and steep portion of the continental shelf is exposed the effect will be like that downstream of the axis of an uplift that lowering of will cause channel adjustment throughout most of the river argument that stream will restore its gradient at higher or lower level following change is conceptually correct because if the river is initially at grade then to move its sediment load and water discharge through the channel the original gradient of the stream must be sediment may be greater after channel incision and less after aggradation fallacy in argument is the assumption that the valley slope and channel gradient are identical is not the case and the two dimensional perspective to erroneous for example sinuous river gradient less than that of the valley floor is the ratio between channel length and valley length and it is also the ratio between valley slope and channel gradient as straight channel sinuosity of and the gradient of the channel and the slope of the valley floor are the same been that can respond to major of water and sediment load primarily by pattern and that much of the pattern variability of large alluvial such as the mississippi indus and nile reflect the variability of the valley slope al al and of fall on channel length and pattern text for discussion this concept geometrically and it the impact of the lowering of in valley with stream of sinuosity the line the channel profile and the line the profile of the valley floor and are at the river mouth and and are at the same location in the valley the channel distance is one third longer than the valley distance and the difference in channel and valley slope the sinuosity of the stream the length of the channel is times the length of the valley and therefore the stream gradient is one third less than the valley slope equation vertical fall of from to and to is assumed channel incision and lateral erosion will steepen the valley floor the channel is not confined laterally it can adjust to the valley slope by increasing sinuosity to and the channel profile is extended to this case incision at point in the valley and at point in the channel because the increase of sinuosity from to from to constant channel gradient over the reach of valley slope the one third increase of channel length sinuosity between and for one third of the valley floor from to to the effect of this fall would be upstream to point where an amount of erosion equal to would occur because the stream can adjust the of the valley floor will not result in change of stream gradient the channel and the effect of lowering is only relatively short distance upstream the distance will undoubtedly depend on local and the original slope of the valley floor but this exercise contention that pleistocene sea level change in the lower mississippi valley was effective only as far as see also and and the probability that large river can adjust in this fashion is made more likely by the fact that the in nature will take place relatively slowly and not abruptly unlike during the experimental the river therefore more time to adjust by sinuosity evidence for the type of channel response shown in is by the experimental of jeff oral relatively slowly to maximum of in flume with total length of change would have doubled the channel gradient the effect of the lowering extended only upstream and the change in was by an increase of sinuosity from to in the lower in the flume is clear however that pattern change did not totally compensate for the change of channel and roughness thereby assuming part of the adjustment to the change that sinuosity increase which in slope decrease was only part of the adjustment and width depth and roughness to decrease velocity and stream power channel pattern change may only absorb part of valley slope or change the nile an example of such adjustment with both sinuosity and width as valley slope and of valley floor gradient provide an explanation of downstream pattern but of valley floor slope can be the result of several activity may change the slope of the valley floor and have its effect on the channel pattern addition high sediment transporting tributary may build fan like deposit in the valley which will persist even after the tributary sediment load the main river this fan pattern will result as the river to maintain constant gradient to the jordan in israel have fan like in the valley and the valley floor of the jordan as result the jordan as it one of these as it the upstream flatter part of the fan and then it more sinuous course on the steeper downstream side of the fan is important to realize that that lie pattern threshold may change their dramatically with only slight change in the variable for example some that are and that are pattern become braided with only small addition of bed load and field confirm that change of valley floor slope will cause change of channel morphology the change will differ however depending where the channel on plot such as that of and depending on the type of channel for example with increasing slope straight channel will become sinuous low sinuosity channel will become more sinuous and channel will braid decreasing slope braided channel will meander and channel will straighten of degradation and aggradation associated with uplift and faulting pattern may dominate river response deposition in of reduced gradient is likely as is channel incision and bank erosion in of gradient fact upstream deposition will reduce downstream sediment thereby increasing the tendency for downstream erosion in addition to the primary valley floor deformation by active tectonics and the secondary channel response to this deformation there are third order effects beyond the area of deformation for example deposition upstream from the axis of dome can progress further upstream by backfilling beyond the area of active deformation that the uplift is acting as dam and unless erosion on the steeper downstream side of the uplift sufficient sediment to compensate erosion will occur downstream beyond the of deformation it is more likely that reduced sediment load will accelerate erosion on the steeper downstream reach and when this load downstream aggradation will result of change from to more resistant on meander pattern aspect of both active and is the appearance of more resistant in the channel as the channel alluvium clay gravel armor or bedrock will confine the channel and retard meander shift and bank erosion the result should be deformed or compressed upstream and change of meander character at the contact for example as shift their movement may be retarded if more resistant alluvium or bedrock is jin and fault may present barrier with the result that upstream are compressed and deformed similar pattern will result if the river bedrock as it an upwarp or if as result of incision it resistant in portion of its course and the russian literature and that for crossing the number of occur upstream of the which of bedrock in the colorado is the reverse of what is for alluvial from the relation of an investigator must not simply base on river pattern alone is usually assumed to hide the underlying geology but of active tectonic movement are sufficiently rapid to affect the morphology and behavior of alluvial being the most sensitive of the landscape will provide evidence of even slow aseismic tectonic activity for example evidence of active tectonics is as deformation of valley floor longitudinal profile deformation of channel longitudinal profile change of channel pattern change of channel width and depth conversion of to low terrace of active channel incision or lateral shift effects both upstream and downstream of the zone of deformation degradation aggradation flooding bank erosion formation of are sensitive of change but they also adjust to of hydrology and sediment load as well as to active tectonics it may be difficult to determine the cause of channel change when in fact human have been both discharge and sediment load during historic time change alone is not sufficient evidence for active tectonics rather it is one bit of evidence that must be with other morphologic evidence and or that provide clear evidence of deformation many the evidence will be circumstantial anomalous that are not related to artificial tributary lithologic change or may reasonably be assumed to be the result of active tectonics until proved otherwise can also provide information on subsidence and ria can be evidence of tilting or even hydrologic and climatic for example during pleistocene aggradation in the ohio and mississippi numerous formed in tributary care must be when the tectonic significance of and other river the future of massive economic forced william organization man to walk permanently out of the front of the corporation many of the of traditional career path shortly behind the wake of his departure people were left pondering how they would survive without job for life corporate road map to guide their destiny and the hierarchy to define their status or place in society orderly external for action and linear career however just what is the future of career the career to the level of the individual does free agency prevail and form of career anarchy result there anything that can be about if everyone to be doing their own thing argue here that the answer is an emphatic yes the new environment shift from and linear development to perpetually career and as result shift from bounded by relatively stable and occupational to where uncertainty and flexibility are the order of the day is increasingly common the concept of the career is broadly based and intended to reflect the emergent pace of economic change does not any single career form but rather range of possible that defy traditional employment arthur rousseau the myriad of career over lifetime of work can appear overwhelming complex web of from numerous among and the interplay may seem downright chaotic much so that one may be to think that no can be drawn from this seemingly random micro level despite the large amount of publicity as organization man was shown to the door large proportion of people who participate in the work place and even whole never really by the traditional anyway for these people and the career is simply business as usual is business to which we can turn to understand better the future of career or as we see the future the career focus in this chapter on where career appear to be well established and fruitful where open labour have examination that seemingly random micro level result in the creation of emergent pattern and order examination not only order but remarkable stability the absence of external people to learn and make sense of their the resulting social interdependence new form of cohesiveness that in turn new structure level gather the force and the power to shape macro level and is rather than that is the catch word of the career this chapter we set out to explore the pervasive nature of present theoretical perspective through which we can understand the dynamics of by descriptive analysis evidence of theory in practice in two selected we present relevant of karl work and and discuss the process of enactment then examine the industry conclude by refining the by key of enactment and other of the process enactment perspective exploration in this chapter is framed in the perspective of karl work theoretical lens for explaining the at work in career conception of enactment directly related to his previous work on the dynamics of the characteristic interdependence that in the enactment view that action the environment is people create and out of their own and simple analogy is with the legal system enact which become part of the legal system which in turn further leading people to enact new and so on legal system continually from the enactment of individual career evolve from the enactment of individual way to engage with enactment is to relate it to the process of natural selection to unfold through successive of enactment selection and retention whereby the enactment of rise to of work this standpoint the basic theme for the entire model is found in the following recipe for can know what think until see what say the form of the recipe enactment is saying action selection is seeing what say perception and retention is knowing what think enactment is saying then it is in essence the action of in their environment that the process someone action or with their environment it immediately and hence the individual part of their environment for example if you believe certain group of to be hostile when you interact with them your may reflect your fear response they may sense that fear and behave in hostile manner the environment becomes hostile you have to that hostile environment the result is circular self relationship self prophecy alternative perhaps more satisfactory circular relationship could result if instead of fear you initially confidence do we relate this process to for this it is important to understand that there is less room for personal or enactment if there are clear salient and traditional bounded and the proliferation of structure hierarchy detailed job and established road provide an of articulated and social to guide the situation is strong in as much as it little scope for improvisation the pure form of the career however such explicit do not exist of providing clear employment are by ambiguity fall short of providing sufficient for consistent or even similar for those operating within them weak are not able to interpret in the same way and the resulting ambiguity the door to myriad personal and for enactment engage in stable process of trial and error that an evolutionary system join together in improvisation that to form new and to guide their further the process through the unfolding of illustrate the preceding argument we will apply to provided by on the dynamics of the and by candace jones on the independent film industry reinterpret the of these by explicitly re framing them within framework and we it is these three and their original and that deserve the major part of the credit for this chapter show how enactment and associated of self and learning come to life we will trace the process of enactment in each setting we will describe the that have to career in each example we will cite some of the that make the resulting weak that we will discuss the social and collective that fill the resulting void in the environment we will point out the order and shape we see enactment to each of these respective doing so we hope to convey the pervasive of both the process of enactment and the vehicle through which it the career the the is notorious for the individual and collective success of its much so that the name come to be synonymous with the electronics industry the region is as the for excellence and innovation and given rise to some of the most influential and its inception the with an individualistic open labour market the learning that emanate from associated career are as key source of competitive advantage for the region can argue that the is necessary feature of operating in dynamic industry that constant innovation point out that in order to learn and solve the in rapid technological advancement knowledge must be among in symbiotic balance between operation and competition appear more prominently when an industry is knowledge rather than capital intensive or when operate in economic other industry and several notable large electronics do not engage with may therefore attribute the of the to its heritage believe this is in part due to the location of the region hosting californian alternative in geographical isolation from the established industry the site had an empty slate and no institutional like the late william key and highly influential founder of the region believe that success stemmed from the learning of an open labour market routinely the following advice you want to succeed here you need to be willing to do three change often talk to your and take even if it failing was himself by his dean of william mentor and an influential board member collins and philosophy the region fierce inter firm competition open information exchange is common practice among the of the contribute to weak environment the high pace of technology and product life fluidity of firm formation and failure rapid employee turnover resulting in little specific as well as lack of meaningful institutionally based hierarchy all contribute to an environment in which rely on alternative to guide their for example in the technology quickly and competition is tough form almost overnight and many disappear just as quickly come and go like in the night it is not surprising that tend to identify with their profession not their company loyalty is not only to their profession but to the host industry region as one local semiconductor executive reportedly noted of us wake up in the morning thinking that we work for view job as the norm job tenure is in the area of two and annual turnover is around and often higher for smaller as one engineer two or three is about the at job for the because theres always something more interesting across the street and cross company at pace that the of within the of any single company and instead inter company exchange that upon leaving company they may well work together again in the future colleague might become customer or competitor boss could be subordinate based hierarchy therefore its the respect and authority are through competence technical excellence and market share with the highest regard to successful the context of this weak environment clear social as structure built at the micro level seek to form and in order to learn and thrive in their surroundings the information is the life blood of the industry and continuous learning through is the key to successful career build their own competence by active membership in the learning community place in the pub or club the early days it used to take place in the infamous

gossip as crucial of their business as one local manager lunch conversation or beer learn that company or company technology you want it your needs build it into your next product this manner micro level influence the creation of new and is through such social interaction and collective action that we begin to understand how and order emerge in the the absence of hierarchy and in the rely on their rather than on formal position to provide reference point for their self are by professional social which provide tacit road map about who who and who does what in the industry serve as efficient job search and makeshift recruitment as one engineer dont just hire people out of the blue general its people you know or you know someone who them impose structure on and looser is the region and its rather than the firm that define for individual and collective in while high of job mobility and new firm formation lead to local for individual they also foster dynamic process of adaptation that the evolution of the region of the latest in design production and marketing is diffused rapidly throughout the area the result is an exceptional rate of technical and innovation by complex mix of social solidarity and individualistic competition the resilience of economy that an unpredictable open labour market and seemingly chaotic career and have led to macro economic stability for the region and hence continued opportunity for the community at large many of these job hoppers may well have led more stable than the upwardly mobile organizational men of the who were

to teach professional play key role linking to workplace the process of learning the ropes are and begin to make key that help progress them to the next of their career people engage in collective

film industry only do we observe distinct of we see aggregate social one can see from the pattern of progression that in the film industry is that although few formal exist persistent social and repeated of interaction can be the process of their engage in the cohesive social of the industry which serve to guide the of their development this respect in the and the film industry have much in common with in film making project based as can be in the through the development of technology and tightly knit project in film clear pattern also that micro level shaping macro activity on enactment and communion of our previous suggest that the enactment of through mixture of personal initiative and mutual operation marshall after to the in this mixture as agency and communion very basic level agency is about control and communion is about operation is individualistic and by autonomy independence initiative and adaptation is fundamental to in that people are ultimately responsible for their own development in contrast to agency is concerned about tolerance and trust is fundamental to in that people need to manage their own for working with weak in which are not defined and not both agency and communion are by which people respond to uncertainty direction and drive to career and to diffuse ambiguity by providing vision and long term to its own however agency may cause strong to reform the balance of power to be lost and most importantly the trust and operation necessary for people and information to move across to be the platform for mutual support and collective learning through which may be unbridled communion may neglect to attend to the and through which effective collaboration can occur the and independent film making illustrate the interplay of agency and communion through the individual initiative and enthusiasm people bring to their within their adopted communion through the collaborative ways of working that substitute for more formal the combination of current high technology or film making while it simultaneously people for further development community building that will influence the make up and effectiveness of future project will thrive our suggest as long as agency and communion are to work in tandem rousseau arthur of work frequently lament loss of community in employment in calling for return to community these frequently look no further than the single company enactment perspective that can be much more broadly diffused the and film making demonstrate that host as well as their provide alternative for community building to occur of community stemming for example from ideological family educational ethnic or gender can also provide enduring support for career arthur notably marshall the feminine of communion versus the masculine of agency do not do so here although it may be interesting to contemplate whether the is in the sense related concept is that of reciprocity cannot be all to all people all of the

vacation time promotion and social acceptance were most reserved for those who had their time contrast those who employer were handicapped by the loss of the that they left behind the and film making suggest different logic one where the old entitlement based are hindrance to career employment are too fluid to assume the of traditional loyalty based employment the case employment reflect spot contract simple exchange of work for immediate financial payment our suggest are at work are to participate in high technology and film making for the that they bring that have been from previous the

common one in contemporary employment and one that many to seek new employment when their learning slows down arthur the concept of reciprocity the significance of project based which an underlying

really too great step to extend the same belief in the capacity for learning to the at large the at large can learn what are the social that best sustain new learning the determination of what is to

of architecture in hand they plumb the of the master of the past of the past may also explain why tend to resist being according to style they instinctively understand that the history of the

first building of the renaissance the very same time he was building great dome over the crossing of the cathedral of florence in style that was not but distinctly gothic pointed arches and all the

also to the way that something was written sense of technique carried over to english and the original meaning of style was those of literary composition that to the form rather than to the substance

architecture in in adopted this literary meaning as metaphor and architectural style as example rustic regal or heroic in the organization of and in the decoration of is the poetry of architecture he taught his which alone all the truly interesting style the way that something was written expressed or style in sense the way that something was built architecture is often defined in of such as space

see when we look at brickwork see the between the and the mortar which can be flush or scraped out to create the bonding the way that the turn the corner the surrounding of and the connection between

and morbidity are well the goal is to determine whether analyses based on of life or on would provide substantively different and which measure would yield more powerful of weight modification in older and design the the is population based longitudinal study of aged and older at were from random sample of the eligibility in four data were collected for all home interview an annual mail questionnaire and annual clinic information was collected in brief telephone interview after each visit were one with of follow up and the second all african american with of follow up to date collection in and follow up is virtually complete for all surviving mass index was calculated as measured weight in divided by the square of measured height in report from the and normal weight

life is the number of that person lived in the after is the number of in which the person was healthy and is similar in concept to quality life healthy year or active life expectancy based on self rated health is your health excellent very good good fair or poor which was collected every is simple but well known measure which been studied in detail and is predictive of health in many we are examining health status over time we added sixth health state dead were available about of the time used linear interpolation to estimate missing data when there were known before and after the missing value the percent complete to for this analysis we defined as the number of of in which person excellent very good or good health were healthy from for who were never in excellent very good or good health to for who were healthy throughout people their health every reasonably continuous distribution drawback of this simple definition of healthy is that it does not distinguish between fair or poor health and death since all are considered not healthy also used an alternative approach which different value to each level of were similar for the two however and we report only the simpler definition the had to be to include the in the second african american cohort who have been only to date for those and for in the first cohort who did not have complete data we the last of and from their age sex and health at the end of elsewhere article that year and were unbiased for the african american cohort the primary analysis we used year and when they were available and year and plus year and when they were not about of the sample all analyses with and without the who had partially data to ensure that the estimation had not distorted the the goal is to examine the association of and with adjust for possible confounding we chose that were prevalent in the elderly related to mortality and morbidity in previous and likely to be related to include age gender smoking never or

hypertension cardiovascular disease prevalent heart disease peripheral vascular disease or disease maximum thickness of the internal carotid artery depression score serum albumin serum cholesterol and serum creatinine are in more detail elsewhere current and with incomplete data leaving on whom this analysis is based analyses were separately for men and calculated two of as and first on age age squared race and smoking history former or never and second on all of the listed above calculated as person minus from the regression plus the mean for or for men is person is his residual from the regression plus the grand mean the mean of this new variable for group of is the mean for that group was calculated in similar manner calculated two of because of the possibility of over adjustment inappropriately for such as diabetes which may have been causally affected by the person weight plotted mean and against and tested for difference among confidence or analysis of variance we calculated the effect size for each measure each subgroup to the normal group the effect size is the difference in mean or in two divided by their common standard deviation the sample size to detect an effect of this magnitude is proportional to the inverse of the squared effect size large effect sizes are desirable the distribution of key by sex and race age at was and about two of the men and third of the were former had higher mean and higher percent obese than the other three men were most likely to have unintentionally lost more than in the past year white were least likely of the were healthy at to at the end of had data not shown the who were unhealthy fair or poor at about were healthy later was thus substantial change in over time in both the mean and calculated from in the first seven of the study to age for example black but only of maximum possible calculated some additional descriptive statistics shown in the final two of unhealthy life minus and lost to death minus had the most and black men the black had the most of unhealthy life and white men the black men lost the most to death out of while white lost only for about of their were healthy not shown for whites about were healthy whites the gender in statistically significant except for and unintended weight loss gender were significant except for unintended weight loss and weight loss since age there were significant between black and white for unintended weight loss of unhealthy life and lost to death in the sample had higher income and education data not shown for income and education as well as age and former smoking the difference in was no longer statistically significant and whites significantly on weight loss since age of unhealthy life and lost to death adjustment for income and education the difference in weight loss since age was no longer significant had significantly lower and than whites after adjustment for age but the difference after adjustment for the entire set of health related analyses not shown next the relationship of to and the mean of and for age race and previous smoking and and also for the entire set of and for example for for age race and smoking for with below but for with from to the second column which for all is not very different the only discrepancy is for men with category only men for extensive also made little difference for and analyses are only for age race and former smoking as above the group with from to would be considered normal by the but had lower and than those with in all for this reason and to increase sample size for those with low we combined the two lower underweight as under plot of and by sex and for each category the mean and its confidence interval are plotted whose confidence do not overlap or overlap only slightly are significantly different the are slightly offset to permit all error to be seen for the uppermost curve on about out of and no evident association between and for above about than other with normal group men also had lower but this group was not significantly different from the normal group in part because of low sample size classified as normal overweight or obese all had about the same the lowermost two in mean for and men who were normal or overweight about the for underweight or obese was about which was significantly lower than the normal group the relationship of to for men is similar but among were not statistically significant was significantly higher for than for men in the normal and overweight but the had similar in the underweight and obese next present the effect size for each group to the normal group the effect sizes are shown in with the significance of the associated for the in of the two being for example underweight to for normal and the common standard deviation was the effect size is thus the two had significantly different that the effect size is also significantly greater than zero clinical trial of treatment to help underweight achieve normal weight presumably by the underlying cause could be to have power with about per treatment arm if year were the outcome measure the biggest effect sizes are in the first row underweight to normal and have similar effect sizes for and are significantly different from zero the effect sizes are not significantly different from zero for men in part because there were only men in the underweight category the effect size overweight to normal small non significant effect sizes with inconsistent suggesting extremely large sample sizes would be for obese to normal only for large and significant effect size an intervention to improve the health of underweight to that of their normal weight could be either or as the outcome variable to make obese comparable to normal could be but not to improve the health of the other to that of the would probably be fruitless since there is no evidence that being overweight for men or or obese for men or as above we repeated these analyses excluding the with partially data and two different ways of the only substantive change was that some of the between and whites shown in no longer statistically significant due to smaller sample size weight and overweight have defined obesity without reference to age al desirable of for aged to al for older men and for older the overweight as opposed to the obese are no different from those of normal weight suggesting that these two could be combined for older future in life expectancy may be limited the may be made by improving people that the development of future should take or other of quality of life into account for clinical on these to address obesity in older could be efficient if but not was the outcome measure is who from being obese to being normal would likely show in but not of weight modification for older who were merely overweight would appear to be fruitless since the would probably not have direct effect on either or or weight change are sometimes used as the outcome in of such as diet or exercise the fact that weight is not associated in consistent way with health that such should be considered critically when older are the is particularly important in the light of recent which found that such as weight loss may be harmful for older the associated with higher weight are especially unclear and the optimal outcome for trial of weight loss in older specific attention to health and mortality the health were found for underweight older whose objective was to make the underweight as healthy as their normal weight presumably by the underlying that the low weight could be efficiently either or as the outcome measure and would be clinically significant in this patient group were somewhat than the average older adult however adjustment for detailed made little difference in the the last four of health data for about of the sample but with and without this group were similar of mean instead of the more traditional survival analysis survival analysis was appropriate here since virtually no were lost to follow up by over adjustment are probably not large since the were not sensitive to the number of for are for year follow up the relative superiority of to would probably hold in with shorter follow up the effect sizes in also be appropriate in shorter since lengthy often add little information on which was based might have some effects of obesity on risk for future health person who is depressed because of poor self image related to obesity or who arthritis related to obesity and to to successfully avoid pain would surely have worse than based on from many health designed specifically to measure those might be more sensitive to change in weight than were based on such the superiority of to would likely be even greater than that shown here more sensitive might also have between the overweight and normal weight but we think this is unlikely given the absence of any in for desirable weight have been for mortality rather than health found between and obesity that were not present in the mortality analysis suggesting that may be more sensitive measure of the burden of obesity in older especially for to determine desirable weight should include of either or however we found no excess risk for older who would be classified as overweight by the as the outcome measure in clinical obese or underweight older and discouraging that address older who are merely overweight declared mass index for your health excellent very good good fair or poor life of healthy life of life the problem and one recently placebo clinical trial have unequivocally that coenzyme reductase reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with coronary disease found that when with placebo significantly reduced the incidence of death myocardial infarction unstable angina percutaneous and surgical coronary and stroke in with stable coronary disease who had experienced an acute coronary syndrome within three to six of enrollment were these did not assess the effect of lowering therapy on adverse cardiovascular in those with recently unstable coronary disease lowering therapy would provide incremental benefit if immediately following an acute coronary syndrome is an important issue as the risk of recurrent adverse cardiac is much greater in with unstable coronary disease than in the stable setting the with trial set out to answer this question the answer enrolled within mean of admission for unstable angina or non wave myocardial infarction and them to of or placebo once daily the major exclusion criteria were total cholesterol level greater than wave myocardial infarction on admission or during the previous month and coronary in the before admission during the index hospitalization or following hospital discharge the primary efficacy was composite of death non fatal myocardial infarction sudden cardiac death or emergent for worsening symptomatic myocardial ischemia included stroke worsening heart failure need for coronary and change in throughout the study average were of age approximately were men caucasian and the mean low density lipoprotein cholesterol level was treatment was associated with absolute reduction in the risk of the primary relative risk confidence interval reduction was primarily driven by the absolute reduction in incidence of emergent for symptomatic myocardial ischemia the risk of death nonfatal myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death were each no different between the two there were no significant in the incidence of worsening heart failure or need for coronary did reduce the incidence of fatal or non fatal stroke by also significantly reduced total and cholesterol and triglyceride but did not significantly change high density lipoprotein cholesterol by the mean cholesterol to in but to among placebo no serious adverse as the result of treatment with although reversible liver elevation more than three times the upper limit of normal in of versus of placebo the the efficacy and safety from were unique for number of lowering therapy was associated with significantly lower mortality when early after an acute coronary syndrome in two large observational was the first trial to suggest that clinical in this setting was also the first trial to identify short term ie within clinical benefit from therapy in previous secondary prevention the benefit of therapy was not evident for one to two while clinical trial safety may be considered less glamorous most important contribution may have been that high dose therapy was not associated with serious harm despite its use in the unstable setting secondary prevention had with unstable coronary largely out of theoretical concern that in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation might destabilize healing plaque no harm from this aggressive treatment strategy should allay theoretical and by doing so remove major obstacle to the inpatient initiation of therapy after coronary the not so these unique and important there were number of inherent study worth and foremost the possibility of null treatment effect cannot be given the wide confidence and hence marginally significant value of for the effect of on the primary efficacy while the number of lost to follow up was small if adverse had in those with but not placebo the overall trial may have been neutral rather than positive the of in are also worth for recurrent myocardial ischemia is an important determinant of quality of life and health care other important were not significantly affected death myocardial infarction sudden cardiac death worsening heart failure need for coronary the question of whether can prevent these and other adverse when soon after an acute coronary syndrome will require further study the short duration of follow up is also particularly troubling it is impressive that clinical benefit was after only of therapy the risk of adverse clinical throughout the year following an acute coronary syndrome longer clinical follow up it is not possible to assess the intermediate term effect if any of on hard such as death or myocardial infarction do so would be critical in light of the lack of effect on these important at no late clinical follow up is were also number of that may have the study who underwent recent or in whom it was were who underwent percutaneous coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery within the previous three or six respectively were not eligible for inclusion the reasoned that recurrent ischemic in this population were likely to result from or bypass graft closure and that would be less likely to affect these number of have established the of therapy early after coronary number of recent have that higher risk with non elevation acute coronary fair better when an early invasive strategy is applied and it is not uncommon for to be in this fashion with wave myocardial infarction were not eligible for enrollment because it was felt that would not influence the development of important prognostic such as left ventricular systolic dysfunction ventricular or mechanical who develop electrocardiographic represent substantial proportion of all with myocardial infarction their short term risk following hospital discharge is lower relative to those with non wave myocardial infarction it is still much greater than in with stable coronary disease and the need for secondary prevention in this population is equally important despite the high risk nature of enrolled ie electrocardiogram and or other objective evidence of ischemia the rate of platelet glycoprotein inhibitor utilization was quite low therapy to be cost effective especially among high risk and is under current american of american it may not be possible to ascertain whether these apply to all with recent acute coronary regardless of the small difference in number of primary between and placebo make it difficult to dissect the relationship between and treatment effect further it remains uncertain whether one can extrapolate the trial to those who undergo coronary shortly before or after coronary event who present with wave myocardial infarction who are with platelet glycoprotein or who have relatively low admission cholesterol to change current practice and the two cohort suggest that lowering exert short term clinical when soon after an acute coronary syndrome this remains an open question if these are not confirmed after further study one could still make compelling argument that lowering therapy barring should be early and universally in who present with an acute coronary syndrome the long term safety and effectiveness of for the secondary prevention of stable coronary disease is well established as by these are safe when at the time of hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome the in hospital initiation of lowering therapy to promote greater long term utilization of these although may be unreliable in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome excepting total and cholesterol the overwhelming majority of with coronary disease will ultimately require both pharmacologic and non pharmacologic lowering to attain cholesterol are even more stringent data from the recently suggest that clinical may accrue independent of cholesterol level to withhold lowering therapy from who present with an acute coronary syndrome would be to accept the status quo and to date our at cholesterol lowering in the secondary prevention setting have been dismal ahead the ascertainment and quantification of any incremental benefit by therapy early after an acute coronary syndrome will require confirmation is currently only one ongoing placebo trial of early versus therapy in this setting to the study is the efficacy of early treatment with in following an episode of unstable angina or non wave myocardial infarction the first four will be to daily or placebo those with in the first phase will receive of daily and those with placebo of daily the primary composite is the occurrence of cardiovascular death non fatal myocardial infarction or for an acute coronary syndrome at one year significant in the incidence of adverse during the first four it would suggest an incremental clinical benefit from these early after an acute coronary syndrome accrue but do so later during follow up it would be difficult to discriminate between the effects of more aggressive lowering therapy the or and trial is looking at within days of an acute coronary syndrome and them to either or daily will be over at least for the occurrence of myocardial infarction or other cardiovascular and the this study will not assess the efficacy of early therapy after an acute coronary syndrome rather it will examine the role of more less aggressive lowering in this setting many would consider it unethical to withhold from with established coronary disease it unlikely that additional placebo will be carried out in this area secondary prevention should look at with stable or unstable disease and will need to address the comparative efficacy of different or assess the incremental benefit of combination therapy and determine whether there is serum cholesterol floor below which are unlikely to provide further clinical benefit received honoraria as speaker and

noteworthy that these include the of the limb and the ectodermal of the vibrissae are ectodermal known to be of developmental for morphogenesis and patterning will be of interest to examine the

found the for which treatment might be beneficial for hepatitis alpha for viral hepatitis acid for primary biliary cirrhosis warrant diligent search in all of with abnormal liver function equally to the paper the of the recently attention to the clear in science between and and to the of building across these that should bring the and the world scientific community closer to each other mr the importance of reducing the in science between and that unbalanced distribution of scientific activity serious not only for the scientific community in the but for development itself mr have also been recently by several who present overwhelming evidence for the disparity in scientific output between the and already may for example recent and indicate that in the for some of the global investment in scientific research and development had approximately of the world and produced approximately of all scientific and technical registered by the america and clearly dominate the number of scientific produced annually with and respectively america and clearly dominate the number of scientific produced annually is rather obvious that are able to invest more in science and therefore account for the number of is also likely that there is statistical bias on the part of the as since it american and european far better than those of the rest of the world may alonso and and is the disparity in scientific between the and actually unchanged or even increasing as mr closer look at the over the last decade important in for example latin america and although respectively only and of scientific have the number of their between and by and respectively which is much higher percentage than the by and industrial the percentage of global scientific from america actually by over the same period in the the produced by the for as well as data by the red de de we the in the number and proportion of scientific between the world and the world from until on the as case study surprisingly there was huge disparity in the number of from until with the the lion share by canada latin america as whole only to the total number of scientific in these ten the total number of however is not necessarily the best measure for scientific productivity or technical may relevant for these include the proportional change in the number of and the total number of when corrected for investment in research and development may the proportional change in the number of as comparison revealed that scientific in latin america the most rapidly in the far the and canada analyses correcting the number of overall for the amount of money in research and development for each region also show that in contrast to both canada and the trend in latin america been an increase in relative output throughout the when taking into account the amount of research money available to latin america actually out the and canada by the year the cost of research is undoubtedly in the world due to relatively low researcher overhead and other work these do not explain the substantial increase in the number of per amount of money to research and development in latin america particularly from until relative of scientific productivity such as the number of picked up by the in relation to the number of in particular country also demonstrate that such as latin america are making substantial to science despite the fact that the average proportion of gross domestic product in science in latin america throughout this year period was only of the amount in this scientific productivity is remarkable when we compare it with the relatively low investment in science itself as with the of latin america as whole fact that as group latin america could afford to invest much higher proportion of its in scientific research and development latin american investment in research and development only of the regional in very weak effort with that of the and canada latin american there is high degree of variability in publication rate as well as in financial investment in science and technology have particularly well for example and cuba respectively and per million of research and development investment in the studied which is notoriously high with and even canada such as cuba and have much greater proportion of their in research and development than the other of this region the number of per dollar in research and development been increasing in latin america while decreasing in and canada the in in latin america potential explanation for the increase in scientific productivity in latin america is that scientific development during the was particularly strong for many of this region this would explain the rapid rise in the number of in latin america with the relatively flat in the and canada which were just as well at the beginning of the decade potentially more important question however is why the number of per dollar in research and development been increasing in latin america while decreasing in the and canada pattern could be the result of variety of none of which are mutually exclusive is possible that in international as measure of scientific productivity is becoming more important in latin america to the most productive from the national science development might have been an important stimulus resulting in more scientific among in latin america and the may also have the relative number of in latin america contrast the decreasing in the number of per investment dollar in canada and could reflect trend towards more costly research in scientific from latin america exactly is the relative impact of such as latin america on the scientific community used data to examine the proportion of in the area of ecology the of evolutionary biology conservation biology and global change biology between and in both the two top general science and with impact of and respectively and in the top ecological with impact of region with publication if any of the were with from that region more than one region would receive credit for single publication if that publication had been written by multiple from of different for the top ecological the american of south and america for of the the however latin america only while canada and respectively for and of the top ecological we the data as to the top ecological impact versus the top impact the latin american nearly twice as many to in the second category in the top with in the top suggest that from such as latin america are falling short of reaching the top contrast the somewhat more to the top than the top the difference in the proportion of by the to the top and top was even more pronounced when we it in respect to this case the of the to the top and only of the to the top the proportion of from latin america the and canada across all subject in and were nearly identical to those of the top ecological and latin america had of the within the versus in the top ecological whereas the and canada had versus and versus respectively suggest that the latin american are not away from the two top ranked general science in and was not enough to gain prominence as by the number of of these the latest list of the most in ecology and environmental the overwhelming of from america and no researcher working in latin american institution was included in the these data indicate that the scientific output in the field of ecology in latin america is relatively low impact in the international scientific community and is in the top international despite its robust productivity as measured by the number of per researcher amount were also for al and thus could be general phenomenon in the world there are outstanding scientific in the world who independently are making important to the international scientific community they are the exception in general do latin american often fail to reach the top or become amongst the most in their possibility is that the main research between both are somewhat different and that the top which are in the world respond more to the scientific of the is not to suggest any sort of conspiracy but rather it that the perception of the most important science is linked to the region and that because the major as well as most prominent share similar economic region they also share the same perception of what science is most interesting to them consideration is that more local from are listed by the than similar from there are more high profile regional publication available to from the region whereas much of the research locally in the world is it more than good to become highly scientist international and novel research in multiple scientific these however greater proportion of research money being spent on for in the with the world to the positive in scientific productivity in latin america should not be as reason to be unconcerned about the gap by mr are many compelling for the push to increase scientific input from the world is that science as discipline would benefit from the of many disparate around the world rather than being dominated by two geographic scientific could be much more readily with the and scientific insight of from change and research for example urgently need the scientific input from those that are so important for these global is also critical for the world to promote through research and those of concern that are proportionally greater scientific and social impact upon them are now in which research on priority for the can actually become work in by the research agenda of the world been the case for research on renewable energy in and in cuba are important not only for those of the world but are also in themselves scientific that can greatly advance the knowledge of the rest of the world change and research urgently need the scientific input from those that are so important for global the evidence here that there is long way to go before contribute more equitable share to the international scientific community there are also to be optimistic the relative increase in the number of especially when corrected for the amount of money available in research and development that many are heading in the right direction the extremely high scientific productivity of many corrected for and despite the rather limited availability of funds that to the will be an excellent investment by in of as measure of scientific output particularly if these can target the that have the impact there may still be long road to travel we feel optimistic that the by mr are slowly being built are frequently to lose weight even though there is little evidence that overweight is associated with mortality in those over age large population based of non smoking older have the association between body mass index and mortality for relevant found excess risk for with very low but that with moderately high had little or no extra risk except in certain small review of of older drew similar healthy older report gradual weight gain throughout adult life may be that small amount of gradual weight gain is normative and associated with the most robust health as we age been that weight be upwards for age remain controversial however because the number of of older is fairly small and because few have the relation of to quality of life or of healthy life in the elderly older risk may have greater effect on health than on mortality so then behavior change of weight modification might be more successful if they were on health rather than on mortality powered to detect in would often require than to detect survival or cardiovascular this paper we study whether at is associated with living longer and or with more of being healthy in cohort of older for whom risk subclinical disease and morbidity are well the goal is to determine whether analyses based on of life or on would provide substantively different and which measure would yield more powerful of weight modification in older and design the the is population based longitudinal study of aged and older at were from random sample of the eligibility in four data were collected for all home interview an annual mail questionnaire and annual clinic information was collected in brief telephone interview after each visit were one with of follow up and the second all african american with of follow up to

rated health is your health excellent very good good fair or poor which was collected every is simple but well known measure which been studied in detail and is predictive of health in many we are examining health status over time we added sixth health state dead were available about of the time used linear interpolation to estimate missing data when there were known before and after the missing value the percent complete to for this analysis we defined as the number of of in which person excellent very good or good health were healthy from for who were never in excellent very good or good health to for who were healthy throughout people their health every reasonably continuous distribution drawback of this simple definition of healthy is that it does not distinguish between fair or poor health and death since all are considered not healthy also used an alternative approach which different value to each level of were similar for the two however and we report only the simpler definition the had to be to include the in the second african american cohort who have been only to date for those and for in the first cohort who did not have complete data we the last of and from their age sex and health at the end of elsewhere article that year and were unbiased for the african american cohort the primary analysis we used year and when they were available and year and plus

inappropriately for such as diabetes which may have been causally affected by the person weight plotted mean and against and tested for difference among confidence or analysis of variance we calculated the effect size for each measure each subgroup to the normal group the effect size is the difference in mean or in two divided by their common standard deviation the sample size to detect an effect of this magnitude is proportional to the inverse of the squared effect size large effect sizes are desirable the distribution of key by sex and race age at was and about two of the men and third of the were former had higher mean and higher percent obese than the other three men were most likely to have unintentionally lost more than in the past year white were least likely of the were

significant between black and white for unintended weight loss of unhealthy life and lost to death in the sample had higher income and education data not shown for income and education as well as age and former smoking the difference in was no longer statistically significant and whites significantly on weight loss since age of unhealthy life and lost to death adjustment for income and education the difference in weight loss since age was no longer significant had significantly lower and than whites after adjustment for age but the difference after adjustment for the entire set of health related analyses not shown next the relationship of to and the mean of and for age race and previous smoking and and also for the entire set of and for example for for age race and smoking for with below but for with from to the second column which for all is not very different the only discrepancy is for men with category only men for extensive also made little difference for and analyses are only for age race and former smoking as above the group with from to would be considered normal by the but had lower and than those with in all for this reason and to increase sample size for those with low we combined the two lower underweight as under plot of and by sex and for each category the mean and its confidence interval are plotted whose confidence do not overlap or overlap only slightly are significantly different the are slightly offset to permit all error to be seen for the uppermost curve on about out of and no evident association between and for above about than other with normal group men also had lower but this group was not significantly different from the normal group in part because of low sample size classified as normal overweight or obese all had about the same the lowermost two in mean for and men who were normal or overweight about the for underweight or obese was about which was significantly lower than the normal group the relationship of to for men is similar but among were not statistically significant was significantly higher for than for men in the normal and overweight but the had similar in the underweight and obese next present the effect size for each group to the normal group the effect sizes are shown in with the significance of the associated for the in of the two being for example underweight to for normal and the common standard deviation was the effect size is thus the two had significantly different that the effect size is also significantly greater than zero clinical trial of treatment to help underweight achieve normal weight presumably by the underlying cause could be to have power with about per treatment arm if year were the outcome measure the biggest effect sizes are in the first row underweight to normal and have similar effect sizes for and are significantly different from zero the effect sizes are not significantly different from zero for men in part because there were only men in the underweight category the effect size overweight to normal small non significant effect sizes with inconsistent suggesting extremely large sample sizes would be for obese to normal only for large and significant effect size an intervention to improve the health of underweight to that of their normal weight could be either or as the outcome variable to make obese comparable to normal could be but not to improve the health of the other to that of the would probably be fruitless since there is no evidence that being overweight for men or or obese for men or as above we repeated these analyses excluding the with partially data and two different ways of the only substantive change was that some of the between and whites shown in no longer statistically significant due to smaller sample size weight and overweight have defined obesity without reference to age al desirable of for aged to al for older men and for older the overweight as opposed to the obese are no different from those of normal weight suggesting that these two could be combined for older future in life expectancy may be limited the may be made by improving people that the development of future should take or other of quality of life into account for clinical on these to address obesity in older could be efficient if but not was the outcome measure is who from being obese to being normal would likely show in but not of weight modification for older who were merely overweight would appear to be fruitless since the would probably not have direct effect on either or or weight change are sometimes used as the outcome in of such as diet or exercise the fact that weight is not associated in consistent way with health that such should be considered critically when older are the is particularly important in the light of recent which found that such as weight loss may be harmful for older the associated with higher weight are especially unclear and the optimal outcome for trial of weight loss in older specific attention to health and mortality the health were found for underweight older whose objective was to make the underweight as healthy as their normal weight presumably by the underlying that the low weight could be efficiently either or as the outcome measure and would be clinically significant in this patient group were somewhat than the average older adult however adjustment for detailed made little difference in the the last four of health data for about of the sample but with and without this group were similar of mean instead of the more traditional survival analysis survival analysis was appropriate here since virtually no were lost to follow up by over adjustment are probably not large since the were not sensitive to the number of for are for year follow up the relative superiority of to would probably hold in with shorter follow up the effect sizes in also be appropriate in shorter since lengthy often add little information on which was based might have some effects of obesity on risk for future health person who is depressed because of poor self image related to obesity or who arthritis related to obesity and to to successfully avoid pain would surely have worse than based on from many health designed specifically to measure those might be more sensitive to change in weight than were based on such the superiority of to would likely be even greater than that shown here more sensitive might also have between the overweight and normal weight but we think this is unlikely given the absence of any in for desirable weight have been for mortality rather than health found between and obesity that were not present in the mortality analysis suggesting that may be more sensitive measure of the burden of obesity in older especially for to determine desirable weight should include of either or however we found no excess risk for older who would be classified as overweight by the as the outcome measure in clinical obese or underweight older and discouraging that address older who are merely overweight declared mass index for your health excellent very good good fair or poor life of healthy life of life the problem and one recently placebo clinical trial have unequivocally that coenzyme reductase reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with coronary disease found that when with placebo significantly reduced the incidence of death myocardial infarction unstable angina percutaneous and surgical coronary and stroke in with stable coronary disease who had experienced an acute coronary syndrome within three to six of enrollment were these did not assess the effect of lowering therapy on adverse cardiovascular in those with recently unstable coronary disease lowering therapy would provide incremental benefit if immediately following an acute coronary syndrome is an important issue as the risk of recurrent adverse cardiac is much greater in with unstable coronary disease than in the stable setting the with trial set out to answer this question the answer enrolled within mean of admission for unstable angina or non wave myocardial infarction and them to of or placebo once daily the major exclusion criteria were total cholesterol level greater than wave myocardial infarction on admission or during the previous month and coronary in the before admission during the index hospitalization or following hospital discharge the primary efficacy was composite of death non fatal myocardial infarction sudden cardiac death or emergent for worsening symptomatic myocardial ischemia included stroke worsening heart failure need for coronary and change in throughout the study average were of age approximately were men caucasian and the mean low density lipoprotein cholesterol level was treatment was associated with absolute reduction in the risk of the primary relative risk confidence interval reduction was primarily driven by the absolute reduction in incidence of emergent for symptomatic myocardial ischemia the risk of death nonfatal myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death were each no different between the two there were no significant in the incidence of worsening heart failure or need for coronary did reduce the incidence of fatal or non fatal stroke by also significantly reduced total and cholesterol and triglyceride but did not significantly change high density lipoprotein cholesterol by the mean cholesterol to in but to among placebo no serious adverse as the result of treatment with although reversible liver elevation more than three times the upper limit of normal in of versus of placebo the the efficacy and safety from were unique for number of lowering therapy was associated with significantly lower mortality when early after an acute coronary syndrome in two large observational was the first trial to suggest that clinical in this setting was also the first trial to identify short term ie within clinical benefit from therapy in previous secondary prevention the benefit of therapy was not evident for one to two while clinical trial safety may be considered less glamorous most important contribution may have been that high dose therapy was not associated with serious harm despite its use in the unstable setting secondary prevention had with unstable coronary largely out of theoretical concern that in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation might destabilize healing plaque no harm from this aggressive treatment strategy should allay theoretical and by doing so remove major obstacle to the inpatient initiation of therapy after coronary the not so these unique and important there were number of inherent study worth and foremost the possibility of null treatment effect cannot be given the wide confidence and hence marginally significant value of for the effect of on the primary efficacy while the number of lost to follow up was small if adverse had in those with but not placebo the overall trial may have been neutral rather than positive the of in are also worth for recurrent myocardial ischemia is an important determinant of quality of life and health care other important were not significantly affected death myocardial infarction sudden cardiac death worsening heart failure need for coronary the question of whether can prevent these and other adverse when soon after an acute coronary syndrome will require further study the short duration of follow up is also particularly troubling it is impressive that clinical benefit was after only of therapy the risk of adverse clinical throughout the year following an acute coronary syndrome longer clinical follow up it is not possible to assess the intermediate term effect if any of on hard such as death or myocardial infarction do so would be critical in light of the lack of effect on these important at no late clinical follow up is were also number of that may have the study who underwent recent or in whom it was were who underwent percutaneous coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery within the previous three or six respectively were not eligible for inclusion the reasoned that recurrent ischemic in this population were likely to result from or bypass graft closure and that would be less likely to affect these number of have established the of therapy early after coronary number of recent have that higher risk with non elevation acute coronary fair better when an early invasive strategy is applied and it is not uncommon for to be in this fashion with wave myocardial infarction were not eligible for enrollment because it was felt that would not influence the development of important prognostic such as left ventricular systolic dysfunction ventricular or mechanical who develop electrocardiographic represent substantial proportion of all with myocardial infarction their short term risk following hospital discharge is lower relative to those with non wave myocardial infarction it is still much greater than in with stable coronary disease and the need for secondary prevention in this population is equally important despite the high risk nature of enrolled ie electrocardiogram and or other objective evidence of ischemia the rate of platelet glycoprotein inhibitor utilization was quite low therapy to be cost effective especially among high risk and is under current american of american it may not be possible to ascertain whether these apply to all with recent acute coronary regardless of the small difference in number of primary between and placebo make it difficult to dissect the relationship between and treatment effect further it remains uncertain whether one can extrapolate the trial to those who undergo coronary shortly before or after coronary event who present with wave myocardial infarction who are with platelet glycoprotein or who have relatively low admission cholesterol to change current practice and the two cohort suggest that lowering exert short term clinical when soon after an acute coronary syndrome this remains an open question if these are not confirmed after further study one could still make compelling argument that lowering therapy barring should be early and universally in who present with an acute coronary syndrome the long term safety and effectiveness of for the secondary prevention of stable coronary disease is well established as by these are safe when at the time of hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome the in hospital initiation of lowering therapy to promote greater long term utilization of these although may be unreliable in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome excepting total and cholesterol the overwhelming majority of with coronary disease will ultimately require both pharmacologic and non pharmacologic lowering to attain cholesterol are even more stringent data from the recently suggest that clinical may accrue independent of cholesterol level to withhold lowering therapy from who present with an acute coronary syndrome would be to accept the status quo and to date our at cholesterol lowering in the secondary prevention setting have been dismal ahead the ascertainment and quantification of any incremental benefit by therapy early after an acute coronary syndrome will require confirmation is currently only one ongoing placebo trial of early versus therapy in this setting to the study is the efficacy of early treatment with in following an episode of unstable angina or non wave myocardial infarction the first four will be to daily or placebo those with in the first phase will receive of daily and those with placebo of daily the primary composite is the occurrence of cardiovascular death non fatal myocardial infarction or for an acute coronary syndrome at one year significant in the incidence of adverse during the first four it would suggest an incremental clinical benefit from these early after an acute coronary syndrome accrue but do so later during follow up it would be difficult to discriminate between the effects of more aggressive lowering therapy the or and trial is looking at within days of an acute coronary syndrome and them to either or daily will be over at least for the occurrence of myocardial infarction or other cardiovascular and the this study will not assess the efficacy of early therapy after an acute coronary syndrome rather it will examine the role of more less aggressive lowering in this setting many would consider it unethical to withhold from with established coronary disease it unlikely that additional placebo will be carried out in this area secondary prevention should look at with stable or unstable disease and will need to address the comparative efficacy of different or assess the incremental benefit of combination therapy and determine whether there is serum cholesterol floor below which are unlikely to provide further clinical benefit received honoraria as speaker and

these interest in the role of in outside of the central nervous system from the cleft palate phenotype of the and the receptor subunit the genetic data strongly suggest that through to modulate the development of this tissue the data here do not explain the origin of the cleft palate phenotype they do indicate that is expressed in several additional non in the mouse embryo is particularly noteworthy that these include the of the limb and the ectodermal of the vibrissae are ectodermal known to be of developmental for morphogenesis and patterning will be of interest to examine the

autoimmunity also to differ between infection and are rarely seen in in most sicca are not present in with as with the population the prevalence of viral hepatitis in our group of with liver disease was very low and did not account for most of the with abnormal liver function these were not sought in small percentage of these is important to note that to account for subgroup of with exocrine in

different epithelial been as mechanism for the damage seen in different in it been that the target tissue involved in the histopathologic of might be the epithelium it is interesting that the in our study point to the association of liver disease with pulmonary and renal all which are by epithelial damage have been to be active rather than passive in the chronic immune response in but further are to establish the role of liver epithelial in the pathogenesis of hepatic damage in this disease the analysis of expression and secretion pattern in these the existence of liver disease and the presence of in sera been pointed as an indicator that liver pathology might be and similar to that of primary biliary cirrhosis previous lymphocytic infiltration similar to that found in stage of primary biliary cirrhosis been in with abnormal liver function or positivity for our review of we found predominance in liver damage rather than disease which would argue against type of liver damage

analysis the were studied in tertiary care referral center the severity of the disease and the prevalence of the might be different from the general population in many syndrome diagnosis had been sought because of otherwise unexplained non exocrine we could not find an association between use of or other and prevalence of liver function the study design did not allow us to exclude the possibility of over the counter medication use that could have affected measurement toxicity is certainly an important factor to be considered given that most had persistent rather than intermittent of and that the use of was not in the majority of with liver toxic effect of could not be established on the of this study we consider that an evaluation for clinical and serological evidence of liver disease should be done in every patient with particularly if there is evidence of other non exocrine or serological evidence of systemic inflammation no other diagnosis explaining liver disease may be found the for which treatment might be beneficial for hepatitis alpha for viral hepatitis acid for primary biliary cirrhosis warrant diligent search in all of with abnormal liver function equally to the paper the of the recently attention to the clear in science between and and to the of building across these that should bring the and the world scientific community closer to each other mr the importance of reducing the in science between and that unbalanced distribution of scientific activity serious not only for the scientific community in the but for development itself mr have also been recently by several who present overwhelming evidence for the disparity in scientific output between the and already may for example recent and indicate that in the for some of the global investment in scientific research and development had approximately of the world and produced approximately of all scientific and technical registered by the america and clearly dominate the number of scientific produced annually with and respectively america and clearly dominate the number of scientific produced annually is rather obvious that are able to invest more in science and therefore account for the number of is also likely that there is statistical bias on the part of the as since it american and european far better than those of the rest of the world may alonso and and is the disparity in scientific between the and actually unchanged or even increasing as mr closer look at the over the last decade important in for example latin america and although respectively only and of scientific have the number of their between and by and respectively which is much higher percentage than the by and industrial the percentage of global scientific from america actually by over the same period in the the produced by the for as well as data by the red de de we the in the number and proportion of scientific between the world and the world from until on the as case study surprisingly there was huge disparity in the number of from until with the the lion share by canada latin america as whole only to the total number of scientific in these ten the total number of however is not necessarily the best measure for scientific productivity or technical may relevant for these include the proportional change in the number of and the total number of when corrected for investment in research and development may the proportional change in the number of as comparison revealed that scientific in latin america the most rapidly in the far the and canada analyses correcting the number of overall for the amount of money in research and development for each region also show that in contrast to both canada and the trend in latin america been an increase in relative output throughout the when taking into account the amount of research money available to latin america actually out the and canada by the year the cost of research is undoubtedly in the world due to relatively low researcher overhead and other work these do not explain the substantial increase in the number of per amount of money to research and development in latin america particularly from until relative of scientific productivity such as the number of picked up by the in relation to the number of in particular country also demonstrate that such as latin america are making substantial to science despite the fact that the average proportion of gross domestic product in science in latin america throughout this year period was only of the amount in this scientific productivity is remarkable when we compare it with the relatively low investment in science itself as with the of latin america as whole fact that as group latin america could afford to invest much higher proportion of its in scientific research and development latin american investment in research and development only of the regional in very weak effort with that of the and canada latin american there is high degree of variability in publication rate as well as in financial investment in science and technology have particularly well for example and cuba respectively and per million of research and development investment in the studied which is notoriously high with and even canada such as cuba and have much greater proportion of their in research and development than the other of this region the number of per dollar in research and development been increasing in latin america while decreasing in and canada the in in latin america potential explanation for the increase in scientific productivity in latin america is that scientific development during the was particularly strong for many of this region this would explain the rapid rise in the number of in latin america with the relatively flat in the and canada which were just as well at the beginning of the decade potentially more important question however is why the number of per dollar in research and development been increasing in latin america while decreasing in the and canada pattern could be the result of variety of none of which are mutually exclusive is possible that in international as measure of scientific productivity is becoming more important in latin america to the most productive from the national science development might have been an important stimulus resulting in more scientific among in latin america and the may also have the relative number of in latin america contrast the decreasing in the number of per investment dollar in canada and could reflect trend towards more costly research in scientific from latin america exactly is the relative impact of such as latin america on the scientific community used data to examine the proportion of in the area of ecology the of evolutionary biology conservation biology and global change biology between and in both the two top general science and with impact of and respectively and in the top ecological with impact of region with publication if any of the were with from that region more than one region would receive credit for single publication if that publication had been written by multiple from of different for the top ecological the american of south and america for of the the however latin america only while canada and respectively for and of the top ecological we the data as to the top ecological impact versus the top impact the latin american nearly twice as many to in the second category in the top with in the top suggest that from such as latin america are falling short of reaching the top contrast the somewhat more to the top than the top the difference in the proportion of by the to the top and top was even more pronounced when we it in respect to this case the of the to the top and only of the to the top the proportion of from latin america the and canada across all subject in and were nearly identical to those of the top ecological and latin america had of the within the versus in the top ecological whereas the and canada had versus and versus respectively suggest that the latin american are not away from the two top ranked general science in and was not enough to gain prominence as by the number of of these the latest list of the most in ecology and environmental the overwhelming of from america and no researcher working in latin american institution was included in the these data indicate that the scientific output in the field of ecology in latin america is relatively low impact in the international scientific community and is in the top international despite its robust productivity as measured by the number of per researcher amount were also for al and thus could be general phenomenon in the world there are outstanding scientific in the world who independently are making important to the international scientific community they are the exception in general do latin american often fail to reach the top or become amongst the most in their possibility is that the main research between both are somewhat different and that the top which are in the world respond more to the scientific of the is not to suggest any sort of conspiracy but rather it that the perception of the most important science is linked to the region and that because the major as well as most prominent share similar economic region they also share the same perception of what science is most interesting to them consideration is that more local from are listed by the than similar from there are more high profile regional publication available to from the region whereas much of the research locally in the world is it more than good to become highly scientist international and novel research in multiple scientific these however greater proportion of research money being spent on for in the with the world to the positive in scientific productivity in latin america should not be as reason to be unconcerned about the gap by mr are many compelling for the push to increase scientific input from the world is that science as discipline would benefit from the of many disparate around the world rather than being dominated by two geographic scientific could be much more readily with the and scientific insight of from change and research for example urgently need the scientific input from those that are so important for these global is also critical for the world to promote through research and those of concern that are proportionally greater scientific and social impact upon them are now in which research on priority for the can actually become work in by the research agenda of the world been the case for research on renewable energy in and in cuba are important not only for those of the world but are also in themselves scientific that can greatly advance the knowledge of the rest of the world change and research urgently need the scientific input from those that are so important for global the evidence here that there is long way to go before contribute more equitable share to the international scientific community there are also to be optimistic the relative increase in the number of especially when corrected for the amount of money available in research and development that many are heading in the right direction the extremely high scientific productivity of many corrected for and despite the rather limited availability of funds that to the will be an excellent investment by in of as measure of scientific output particularly if these can target the that have the impact there may still be long road to travel we feel optimistic that the by mr are slowly being built is much saying to the epidemiologist geoffrey large number of people exposed to small risk may generate many more than small number exposed to very high risk is true for many individual risk such as salt intake linked to high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease and speeding on the highway linked to and it apply to many other global health the study by anthony and that it does develop effective health one must understand the health and disease scale this is tough challenge the of by the data from around the world on risk such as tobacco malnutrition childhood abuse unsafe sex childbirth and cholesterol as well as on disease for example depression blindness and diarrhea large group of from all over the world framework to analyze these data compare different or they calculate disability life or number of healthy life lost because of particular disease or risk factor and used data from the for risk and from epidemiological of the world to calculate the proportion of risk factor attributable disease burden in different population defined by age sex and exposure level for being underweight in childhood for leading risk factor for global loss of healthy found that only of the disease burden in severely underweight the rest in those only moderately underweight the relative for the moderately underweight are much lower but the number of in that category is so large that the total attributable burden to almost two of the total global burden of disease for that risk factor the analysis to global research showing that many major health are important across the range of exposure not just among exposed to high of risk also to risk that are particularly prevalent among specific and age and for which highly targeted could be effective

pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis recently respond in to inflammatory by growth and collagen resulting in fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition addition lung have

that role in the pathogenesis of human normal idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is much saying to the epidemiologist geoffrey large number of people exposed to small risk may generate many more than small number exposed to very high risk is true for many individual risk such as salt intake linked to high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease and speeding on the highway linked to and it apply to many other global health the study by anthony and that it does develop effective health one must understand the health and disease scale this is tough challenge the of by the data from around the world on risk such as tobacco malnutrition childhood abuse unsafe sex childbirth and cholesterol as well as on disease for example depression blindness and diarrhea large group of from all over the world framework to analyze these data compare different or they calculate disability life or number of healthy life lost because of particular disease or risk factor and used data from the for risk and from epidemiological of the world to calculate the proportion of risk factor attributable disease burden in different population defined by age sex and exposure level for being underweight in childhood for leading risk factor for global loss of healthy found that only of the disease burden in severely underweight the rest in those only moderately underweight the relative for the moderately underweight are much lower but the number of in that category is so large that the total attributable burden to almost two of the total global burden of disease for that risk factor the analysis to global research showing that many major health are important across the range of exposure not just among exposed to high of risk also to risk that are particularly prevalent among specific and age and for which highly targeted could be effective numerous and of like this one such analyses are essential in the distribution of limited funds to lower the burden of life lost to premature death and disability the concept of lung as effector in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis recently respond in to inflammatory by growth and collagen resulting in fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition addition lung have been shown to produce large of inflammatory and in and hence these may also have role as effector inflammatory capacity to produce both inflammatory and fibrotic could mean that phenotypically lung act simultaneously as effector and target via and the fibrotic process are important of fibroblast function is thought to have in but also can have effects both in and in proliferation and and synthesis in several cell and smooth muscle like glomerular smooth muscle cell proliferation and collagen synthesis cell lung contain proximal enzyme in production and can generate been previously that lung have expression to normal lung and hence have production of these and the fact that are important fibroblast we sought to investigate whether in
